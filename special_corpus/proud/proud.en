The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. The Chairman : This morning I wish to start the proceedings of the First Committee by announcing , as most members of the Committee already know , that the 100th Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the Secretary-General and to the United Nations . I congratulate him and am sure that all members will share these congratulations on this well-deserved distinction which has been awarded to the Secretary-General and to the United Nations as an Organization . It is a recognition of the activities of the United Nations and also , I would like to stress , of the future relevance of the United Nations in the world . I am very pleased to be able to make this announcement . In our future activities , including in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation , we should all take heart from this recognition . Agenda items 64 to 84 ( continued ) General debate on all disarmament and international security items Miss Durrant ( Jamaica ) : I have the honour to speak on behalf of the 14 States of the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) that are Members of the United Nations . This is indeed a proud day for the United Nations , a day on which the Secretary-General , Mr. Kofi Annan , and the Organization as a whole have been awarded the centenary Nobel Peace Prize in signal recognition of their contribution to a better-organized and more peaceful world . On behalf of the Caribbean Community , let me join you , Mr. Chairman , in congratulating the Secretary-General and the men and women of the Organization who , in all parts of the world , serve the cause of peace . This award comes at a time when the horrendous acts of terrorism committed on 11 September have left us all shaken and infinitely more aware of our vulnerability , of the fragility of international security and of the need for collective action in the face of unspeakable crimes orchestrated with tools of everyday civilian life . We dare not contemplate the implications for the security of States of the possibility of weapons of mass destruction reaching the hands of unprincipled sponsors of international terrorism who show no respect for human life or for the rule of law . It is our hope that in the wake of these tragic events , and in the wake of the signal award to this Organization , the work of the Committee will be imbued with renewed urgency . We have witnessed during the past year an ebb in the energy and optimism that infused the Committee 's consideration of measures to strengthen the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime during the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly . At that time we celebrated the small but significant achievements of the sixth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , which secured the unequivocal undertaking of the nuclear-weapon States for the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals ; and we echoed the Millennium Declaration , which called for concerted action towards the elimination of weapons of mass destruction . We have , however , not seen those rallying words transformed into demonstrable action : we still stand short of the achievement of universality in nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament ; we still anticipate the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) ; the Conference on Disarmament has yet again failed to reach agreement to begin negotiation on a fissile material cut-off treaty ; and we still pursue security assurances and confidence-building measures to strengthen the regime for the maintenance of international peace and security . This stalled multilateral disarmament agenda presents a disturbing framework within which we must seek to advance an already tenuous international peace and security agenda . It offers little comfort , particularly to small States such as our own , for the void created by the absence of a strong multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation regime is inevitably filled by suspicion and distrust , negating confidence-building measures and heightening the intimidation of lawlessness from State and non-State actors . This threat is true in respect not only of nuclear weapons but also of biological and chemical weapons . We share the concerns expressed at the inability of the Ad Hoc Group on the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development , Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological ( Biological ) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction to advance its work on the elaboration of a draft protocol on verification arrangements . It is our hope that the upcoming Review Conference of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention will contribute towards strengthening this regime , thus reducing the threat posed by such weapons . We also look forward to participating actively in the Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty . Our non-proliferation and disarmament agenda will not advance meaningfully until the inertia in the Conference on Disarmament is overcome . It is disconcerting to receive , year after year , reports of the failure of that important body to agree on a programme of work , precluding substantive consideration of the nuclear disarmament agenda . It is also disappointing that in the debate in this Committee there is rarely mention of the value of convening a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament . Should we then conclude that political will is exhausted ? Recent events do not afford us that option . We should instead make good this opportunity to renew our collective commitment to both nuclear and conventional non-proliferation and disarmament . We welcome the contribution of the Disarmament Commission to this effort through its current deliberation on ways and means to achieve nuclear disarmament and on practical confidence-building measures in the field of conventional arms . We consider that that body can and should play a more integral , supportive role as a deliberative forum within the disarmament infrastructure of the Organization . CARICOM States also recognize the important contribution of nuclear-weapon-free zones towards strengthening the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and in promoting regional security and stability . We maintain that their success is to be found in their establishment on the basis of agreements freely reached among the States of the region concerned . We remain committed to the regime established by the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean ( Treaty of Tlatelolco ) , to which we are a party , and encourage the development of mechanisms aimed at promoting cooperation among the zones with a view to ultimately strengthening the international nuclear non-proliferation regime . This year 's endeavours have not , however , been without success . Of particular importance to CARICOM States was the convening of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects . That meeting was very welcome as a demonstration of the international community 's acknowledgement of the need to urgently address the proliferation and illegal use of these weapons . For vulnerable States such as ours , exposed to this illicit trade often linked to drug trafficking and other forms of organized crime , this was a vital undertaking . The increasing threat to the security and stability of our societies and the challenge to our economic and social development are too serious to ignore . CARICOM States take this opportunity once again to express their appreciation to Ambassador Camilo Reyes Rodríguez , President of the Conference , and to Ambassador Carlos dos Santos , Chairman of the Preparatory Committee , for their skilful management of a sensitive project . We now look forward to early implementation of measures articulated in the Programme of Action at the national , regional and international levels , so as to strengthen the global collective effort to stem the flow of these illegal weapons and to rid our societies of their deadly influence . We share the view , however , that the outcome of the Conference represents a first important step on the long journey towards the achievement of truly effective control of this illicit trade . That objective , we believe , will not be attained until we implement measures to regulate the legal trade in small arms and light weapons , including improved monitoring of firearms dealers and secondary markets , the application of more rigorous standards for arms brokers , and strict import and export authorization regimes . We believe that there is a central role for the Secretariat to play in coordinating all United Nations activities concerning small arms , and in this context we welcome the important role that the Department for Disarmament Affairs , through its coordinating mechanism for action on small arms , continues to play in ensuring regular consultation and coordination among all entities within the United Nations system for which the matter of small arms is of integral concern . CARICOM recommends that these existing mechanisms be strengthened to enhance in-house capacity to undertake more research and analysis on the nature and scope of the problem and to provide practical assistance to affected States . There is still a paucity of data on the small-arms phenomenon . We believe that institutions like the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research should be strengthened with a view to widening the database of information . We also note that the United Nations continues to experience difficulty in recruiting disarmament experts and trainers for service within peacekeeping operations in the field . This need could be addressed in part by encouraging Governments to establish databases of expertise on disarmament to enhance the United Nations capacity when the need arises . These initiatives will , of course , demand additional resources , both human and financial . CARICOM members were therefore very disappointed that the outcome of the 2001 Conference did not see specific commitment to the investment of new and additional resources . Without the injection of fresh resources our efforts will be significantly compromised . We encourage better coordination among existing small arms funds to ensure maximization of the impact of these resources . We also consider that it would be useful to explore the possibility of working more closely with the United Nations Development Programme to identify areas in which its Trust Fund for Support to Prevention and Reduction of the Proliferation of Small Arms , which involves a weapons-for-development approach , can be of assistance in the disarmament component of peacekeeping operations . CARICOM States continue to participate actively in regional initiatives aimed at strengthening the capacity of our States to more effectively control the illegal arms trade and narco-trafficking . Where our subregion is concerned we cannot contemplate solutions to the illicit arms trade without addressing at the same time measures to control the illicit drug trade . Many of these activities are implemented under the sponsorship of the Regional Centre for Peace , Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean , often in coordination with the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission ( CICAD ) of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) . We again use this opportunity to convey our appreciation of the support we receive from these organizations . CARICOM States also note with satisfaction the steady progress achieved in the decreased production of anti-personnel landmines , the destruction of stockpiles , the demining of land and the reduction of casualties from landmine blasts . We consider this an encouraging indication of the commitment of member States to fully implement this Convention , made all the more worthy for its overwhelming humanitarian benefits . We continue to call for more assistance for those States addressing the difficult task of demining and for support for victims of landmine explosions . CARICOM States will continue to raise in the debates in this Committee their apprehension regarding the safety and environmental risks to which coastal States are exposed by the maritime transportation of nuclear waste and other radioactive material . We place great store on the conclusions and recommendations of the Sixth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) last year regarding the strengthening of measures and international regulations to protect States from such risks . The trans-shipment of irradiated material through the Caribbean Sea is of particular concern , and we continue to call for the cessation of this practice . This position notwithstanding , we again underscore the need for the international community to consider the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory framework promoting State responsibility in such areas as disclosure , liability and compensation in relation to accidents . Once again we have been offered the opportunity to refocus the disarmament agenda . If we are to move forward we must do so together . That means that we must somehow find the political will to eschew polarization in the disarmament debate and find common ground on which to renew our dialogue . In the search to achieve disarmament and international peace and security , the words of the eminent Caribbean scholar , Sir Shridath Ramphal , ring true : “ cooperation is no longer merely an option ; it is a precondition of life in the global neighbourhood . It is not just a strategic choice ; it is a compulsion of civilized existence . ” In conclusion , let me convey the congratulations of the member States of CARICOM to you , Mr. Chairman , and to the members of your Bureau on your election to guide the work of this important Committee . I assure you of the full cooperation of our delegation as you discharge your onerous responsibilities . We also wish to express our appreciation to the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs , Mr. Jayantha Dhanapala , and to the staff of the Department for their dedication , demonstrated in the consistently high quality of their work . Mr. Da Silva ( Angola ) : The Angolan delegation wishes at the outset to extend sincere congratulations to you , Sir , and the other members of the Bureau upon your election . We are confident , Sir , that with your rich experience and diplomatic skills our deliberations will come to a successful conclusion . You are assured of the support and cooperation of my delegation . My delegation would also like to express its appreciation to Ambassador Mya Than of Myanmar for the excellent way in which he guided the work of the Committee during the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly . At these very difficult times that still characterize the city of New York , as a consequence of the large-scale devastation and loss of human life caused by the 11 September terrorist attack , we consider it important to highlight the fact that terrorists are the common enemies of all societies and do not come from any particular religion , culture or nationality . Angola , like few others , understands the need to adopt measures to prevent and punish acts of terrorism . My country associates itself with Security Council resolutions 1368 ( 2001 ) and 1373 ( 2001 ) and General Assembly resolution 56 / 1 , which express the commitment of the international community to use all the elements at its disposal to eliminate the threat to peace and security that terrorism represents . Over the past decade in Angola thousands of people have been killed in almost daily terrorist attacks perpetrated by UNITA , led by Jonas Savimbi . The continuous attacks by UNITA against the civilian population correspond to the elements that qualify the crime of terrorism . As such , the fight against this scourge must be global and without any type of discrimination . The tragic impact of those UNITA acts on peace , security , stability and development in Angola raises the understanding and solidarity of the international community as well as the recognition that they also constitute a threat to peace and international security . For that reason the Security Council has many times appropriately condemned UNITA 's actions by imposing sanctions against it . I appeal to all States to comply strictly with the sanctions imposed on UNITA and to cooperate with the monitoring mechanism for sanctions against UNITA as being within the scope of measures to eliminate international terrorism . We are fully aware of the close and complex links between terrorism , organized crime , drug trafficking , illegal exportation of natural resources , and the illegal trafficking and easy availability of small arms and light weapons . At the recent United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects , the outcome of the consensus was the adoption of a Programme of Action as an important step towards the goal of preventing , combating and eradicating the illicit trade . It included guidelines for practical action at the national , regional and international levels . Despite our efforts and determination , small arms and light weapons continue to end up in the hands of terrorist groups , rebels and other unlawful elements . The proliferation , misuse and accumulation of those weapons have devastating effects . It is a reality that , as a practical problem of security , small arms and light weapons have a far more direct impact on the everyday lives of people , and cause far more death , injury and economic loss , than weapons of mass destruction . The challenge that faces us is to strengthen cooperation at the bilateral , regional and international levels that can lead us to the full implementation of the measures contained in the Programme of Action . We share the view that we should continue our discussion at the national , regional and global levels on the need to establish and maintain controls over private ownership of small arms , and the need to prevent sales of small arms and light weapons to non-State actors . We cannot possibly reap any success in fighting terrorism if we do not take comprehensive steps to prevent all kinds of weapons , including weapons of mass destruction , from falling into the hands of terrorist groups . The Third Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use , Stockpiling , Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction held in Nicaragua from 18 to 21 September , was a success . It contributed to further progress with respect to the universality and implementation of the Convention . The entry into force of the Ottawa Convention represents a significant step forward and underlines the international community 's commitment to eliminate the scourge of landmines . Angola , as a State party to this instrument , is strongly committed to its effective implementation . This is an essential part of the framework aimed at addressing this problem . Angola is also committed to strengthening this framework where it is possible to do so . In our view a transfer ban on anti-personnel landmines would complement and reinforce existing instruments . Angola has in place a national programme of action against mines , whose objectives are to create an environment in which people can live and work safely and to meet the concerns and priorities of the victims . To reduce the number of victims , the Angolan Government decided to include in the school curriculum programme the subject of mine awareness activities . Nevertheless , we are faced with the problem that in many areas already identified as mine areas , where we have placed signs to avoid more victims , the UNITA rebels , led by Jonas Savimbi , are removing those signs , thus killing more people , mostly children and women , in the same brutal fashion as any act of terrorism . Once again , there is a need for coordinated action by the international community to achieve the complete elimination of anti-personnel landmines . The non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is a matter of universal concern . Angola , as a developing country , is firmly committed to a non-proliferation regime . We continue to pursue with vigour our strong advocacy of general and complete disarmament . In regard to nuclear tests , we remain committed to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) , which will make a vital contribution to advancing nuclear disarmament by constraining the qualitative improvement in nuclear weapons . Angola supports the outcome of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , which provides the international community with a clear vision of the steps to be taken in the near future . One of the partial measures identified within the framework of the NPT to ensure constructive and steady progress towards nuclear disarmament remains the entry into force of the CTBT , the parties to which will soon meet here in New York to consider ways to obtain the necessary number of ratifications to accelerate its entry into force . Angola recognizes the importance of the early entry into force and full implementation of START II and the conclusion of START III as soon as possible , while preserving and retaining the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems ( ABM Treaty ) as the cornerstone of strategic stability and as a basis for further reductions of strategic offensive weapons . Another most important issue is the prohibition of the production of fissile materials for weapons purposes . The Conference on Disarmament should start deliberations on this problem at the earliest . The priority should be to establish the subsidiary bodies that will make it possible to fully focus on examining this issue in all its aspects . In conclusion , I should like to stress that , since the process of disarmament affects the vital security interests of all States , we must all be actively concerned with , and contribute to , the disarmament and arms limitation measures which play an essential role in maintaining and strengthening international security . Therefore , the role and responsibility of the United Nations in the sphere of disarmament , in accordance with its Charter , must be reinforced . Mr. Hasmy ( Malaysia ) : I join other speakers in expressing my delegation 's , and my own personal , warmest congratulations to you , Sir , on your election as Chairman of the First Committee , as well as to the members of the Bureau on their election . We have full confidence that , given your vast experience and great expertise on disarmament issues , you will be able to guide our deliberations to a fruitful conclusion . I assure you of my delegation 's fullest cooperation in the discharge of your responsibilities . Let me also extend my delegation 's appreciation to Ambassador Mya Than of Myanmar , a member of the Association of South-East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , for the excellent way in which he guided the work of the Committee during the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly . I should also like to take this opportunity to join you , Mr. Chairman , in warmly congratulating the Secretary-General , Mr. Kofi Annan , and the United Nations on being selected to receive this year 's Nobel Peace Prize . This is a fitting tribute to the importance and continued relevance of the United Nations and to the sagacious leadership provided by the Secretary-General , notably in the promotion and maintenance of global peace . The award should inspire us all to redouble our efforts to attain the goals we set ourselves as Members of this Organization , including in the area of disarmament . My delegation associates itself fully with the statement made by the representative of Myanmar , who spoke on behalf of the Association of South-East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , but would like to make additional remarks on issues of particular interest to Malaysia . We are all too aware that , despite the so-called peace dividends resulting from the end of the cold war , achievements in the disarmament area have fallen far short of our expectations . Indeed , in the nuclear disarmament area , progress , if any , has been negligible . In fact , instead of progress towards greater disarmament efforts there have been setbacks , with an additional number of nuclear-weapon States , the weakening of existing nuclear disarmament treaties and a virtually complete standstill in negotiations on nuclear disarmament on both the bilateral and multilateral tracks . Therefore the challenge facing the international community as it tries to realize a nuclear-weapon-free world remains formidable , requiring our total and unqualified commitment to the goals we set ourselves . Our final goal must remain the elimination of all these weapons , not at some vague , never-to-be-defined , remote time in the future , which some people interpret as “ never ” , but within a time-frame that , while distant , is nevertheless possible , realistic and attainable . Towards this end , nuclear disarmament should not be relegated to the back burner , as some would prefer , but must remain a high-priority issue on the global agenda . The mindless , horrific terrorist attacks on the United States , which we have all condemned in the strongest terms , were a shocking and cruel wake-up call for all of us to the danger of international terrorism , to which all countries are vulnerable and which poses the most complex security challenge to our global security today . The incidents reminded us of the fragility of international peace and security and the need for the international community to close ranks in our common effort to ensure that peace and security prevail in the new millennium . In a world that will now have to confront a new , faceless but deadly foe , these events should remind us of the ever-present danger of nuclear terrorism and other weapons of mass destruction . This was recognized by the Secretary-General himself , who aptly told the General Assembly : “ While the world was unable to prevent the 11 September attacks , there is much we can do to help prevent future terrorist acts carried out with weapons of mass destruction ” . Let the words of the Secretary-General spur us towards redoubling our efforts to eliminate these weapons . The States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) agreed at the 2000 Review Conference that there should be no halfway measures in the quest for nuclear disarmament . They concluded that the total elimination of nuclear weapons is the only absolute guarantee against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons . In addition , the nuclear-weapon States took a positive and commendable step in this direction by making an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament . It is , however , necessary to remind ourselves that the nuclear disarmament objectives agreed upon in 1995 , though modest , have not been attained ; hence the need for the concrete implementation of the objectives and principles of the Final Document of 2000 without delay . While it is still too early to determine the fate of the 13 steps to nuclear disarmament agreed at the Review Conference , my delegation hopes that serious efforts will be made to give substance to these undertakings as we approach next year 's first Preparatory Committee meeting for the Treaty 's 2005 Review Conference . We look forward , therefore , to the realization of the commitment made by the United States and the Russian Federation to work actively to bring about a considerable reduction in their nuclear arsenals . We hope that these will not remain platitudes , mere statements of intent that will be repeated at every review conference of the NPT . States Parties to the NPT must address the issue of the universality of the Treaty in a more serious fashion . If the universality of the Treaty is to remain a serious and attainable objective , which it should be , every effort must be made to bring those outside the NPT to accede to it , since clearly having them inside the Treaty would be more desirable than leaving them outside . I believe the objective of the universality of the Treaty will be better served by adopting a common-sense , practical and creative approach . In the global campaign for nuclear disarmament and the elimination of nuclear weapons , the universality of this Treaty , as well as of other relevant treaties and conventions , such as the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) , is an extremely important objective to be attained . We continue to be dismayed , as we have been for the past several years , at the lack of progress at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva . The impasse in the Conference is a matter of serious concern to the international community . We strongly urge the three Special Coordinators designated by the Conference to make every effort to break the impasse and move the negotiations forward . Together with the expansion of its membership and the improvement in the efficiency of its functioning , the Conference should make every effort and move to attain its objectives as soon as possible . National missile defence ( NMD ) has now become the most hotly debated issue on the world security agenda . The continuing impasse at the Conference on Disarmament has been further complicated by developments in the area of anti-ballistic defence systems , specifically the efforts to develop and deploy the so-called NMD . My delegation shares the Secretary-General 's concern over plans to deploy national missile defences , which will inevitably threaten not only current bilateral and multilateral arms control agreements but also ongoing and future disarmament and non-proliferation efforts . A missile defence system will pose serious problems for future progress in arms control , especially deep nuclear reductions . My delegation believes that the security costs of deployment will far outweigh the security benefits . The deployment of such a system will have a highly destabilizing effect on international security and will most likely lead to a new arms race . That would be a major setback to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation . We would strongly urge against the development and deployment of the missile defence system , because of its serious ramifications for international security . My delegation would therefore call for a strengthening of the existing Anti-Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) Treaty while addressing , in more serious fashion , the issue of the threat of global missile proliferation . My delegation is convinced that abrogation of the ABM Treaty would have grave consequences for the future of international security . My delegation is encouraged by the increase in the number of ratifications of the CTBT during the past year . It remains our hope that the remaining number of the 44 countries stipulated in article XIV will accede to and ratify the Treaty so as to effect its entry into force as soon as possible . Malaysia fully recognizes the importance of universal adherence to the CTBT , and is in the process of ratifying it . However , we believe it is important for the remaining article XIV countries to lead the way . The historic Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons , given in July 1996 , was a major and positive development and a significant contribution by the World Court in the campaign for nuclear disarmament . Regrettably , that Opinion continues to be ignored by the nuclear-weapon States . Malaysia and other like-minded countries will continue efforts for follow-up actions to the Advisory Opinion of the Court at this and future sessions of the General Assembly . We hope that , as in previous years , the draft resolution to be put forward in this Committee will continue to enjoy wide support from Member States of the Organization . As advances in biotechnology are increasing the potential threat posed by biological weapons , there is an urgent need to speed up the negotiations on a verification regime for the Biological Weapons Convention ( BWC ) . Today the BWC is more significant than ever and the spirit that inspired it is very much alive . However , many years of efforts to conclude a protocol to strengthen this key Treaty have ended abruptly due to the decision of a major negotiating partner which opposes the draft composite text of the protocol that was presented at the twenty-fourth session of the Ad Hoc Group . We also regret that the Group could not even adopt a final report on its work . However , we look forward to the Treaty 's next five-year Review Conference , scheduled to convene in Geneva next month , in the hope that it will provide another opportunity to revisit this issue . It is imperative that those States that have not ratified or acceded to this Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) should do so at the earliest opportunity so that the Conventions ' effectiveness will be further enhanced through their universality . We believe this goal is attainable , as these Conventions have made an important contribution towards the world community 's collective efforts to eliminate the threat of weapons of mass destruction . Conventional weapons have become even more sophisticated , and hence more lethal . Thanks to the aggressive marketing efforts of the arms vendors of , mostly , the industrialized countries , these weapons are now in the arsenals of impoverished countries which can ill afford them . In an unprecedented move , the 2001 United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects that took place in July , adopted a Programme of Action at the end of the Conference . This Conference marked a significant step towards the goal of preventing , combating and eradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons . What remains is for States to fulfil their respective obligations under the Programme of Action . Malaysia believes that the issue of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons must be viewed from a holistic perspective of arms control and disarmament , post-conflict peace-building , conflict prevention and socio-economic development . In the context of conflict situations , the problem should be seen comprehensively in the framework of disarmament , demobilization and the reintegration of ex-combatants . My delegation is proud to announce that Malaysia became the first mine-free country in Asia in January this year , as we have completed our stockpile destruction of anti-personnel landmines and , therefore , accordingly fulfilled our obligations under article 4 of the Ottawa Convention . We remain committed to the attainment of a truly universal ban of anti-personnel landmines . The destruction of almost 95,000 anti-personnel landmines began in mid-January this year and took place at three different locations in Malaysia , using one of the safest and effective methods available . Malaysia is firm in its conviction that humanitarian sufferings caused by anti-personnel landmines far outweigh their military utility . It remains our hope and expectation that there will be a stronger political push for universal acceptance of this Treaty . In this regard , we welcome the positive outcome of the Conference of States Parties held in Managua recently , which will result in the more efficacious implementation of the Ottawa Convention . Malaysia takes pride in the role it played in shaping the Treaty on the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone along with our partners in ASEAN . The establishment of these zones is an important and integral part of the nuclear disarmament process . We continue to believe that the establishment of these zones in various parts of the world will help to create conditions conducive to peace and stability and to promote regional confidence building . My delegation attaches great importance to the promotion of such zones and strongly supports their establishment in other parts of the world , particularly in West Asia or the Middle East , as called for in the resolution on the Middle East adopted at the 1995 NPT Review Conference and reconfirmed at the 2000 Review Conference . Malaysia believes in the importance of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms and strongly supports it . We fully recognize the need for increased transparency in armaments and that the United Nations has an important role in promoting it . Efforts in respect of conventional weapons , important as they are , should not detract from nuclear disarmament efforts , which should always remain a top priority issue on the international agenda until these horrendous weapons have been completely eliminated from the face of the earth . Malaysia therefore commends the Secretary-General for his call for the convening of an international conference to consider all aspects of the nuclear-weapons issue , and would strongly encourage him to follow up on his laudable proposal . The convening of such a conference will provide an opportunity for the international community to rededicate and recommit itself to the goals of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation , leading towards the realization of a world entirely free of nuclear weapons . Given the formidable challenges ahead of us , we should never relent in the concerted campaign for nuclear disarmament . We should not succumb to creeping complacency or arguments that everything is all right on the disarmament front . In this regard , we acknowledge and highly appreciate the positive role of non-governmental organizations in sustaining global interest in nuclear disarmament issues . Let me commend them for their supportive but important role , which has inspired us to move the disarmament process forward by sharing their knowledge and expertise with us . Malaysia considers them to be indispensable partners in a common cause . They are truly the conscience of humanity , acting as beacons and showing us the way to a world eventually free of all weapons of mass destruction . In conclusion , my delegation would like to take this opportunity to pay the highest tribute to the Department of Disarmament Affairs , under the able and dynamic leadership of my friend , Under-Secretary-General Mr. Jayantha Dhanapala , who I am pleased to see is on the podium , for its work in promoting the disarmament agenda of the United Nations . Mr. Ikouebe ( Congo ) ( spoke in French ) : Like other speakers who have spoken before me , I wish warmly to congratulate you , Sir , on your election to the Chair of the First Committee and for the manner in which you are guiding our debate . Your entire Bureau can rely upon the full support and cooperation of my delegation , which is taking up our work in the spirit of openness and conciliation . I also wish to take this opportunity to condemn , once more , the heinous recent attacks which struck our host city , New York , and America as a whole , and to convey once again to the American people and Government our deep sympathy . The historic debate which took place right here last week was an opportunity for the entire international community firmly to commit itself to strengthen cooperation in fighting the serious scourge of international terrorism . These criminal acts highlight the urgent need for profound thought on the nature of the dangers threatening the world today . Our perception of the threat would thus be altered and the concept of security resulting from it would lay down guidelines for defining and putting into effect a new form of international cooperation . The climate of tension that has prevailed since the resurgence of the terrorist risk gives special poignancy to the present nature of the debates in the Committee , some of which have been going on for decades . The time seems ripe for an increase in our collective awareness in order to speed up significant progress in the areas under discussion , namely peace and security and general and complete disarmament . It is on these items that my delegation now wishes to make a few observations . First , with regard to international peace and security , in addition to the need for increased international cooperation under the auspices of the United Nations , we need to emphasize more than ever global and coherent strategies for conflict prevention . In this context we can never overstate the need to strengthen the role and increase the ways and means of the United Nations to prevent conflicts . Recommendations contained in the report presented by the Secretary-General to the General Assembly and the Security Council last June on the prevention of armed conflict , should be appropriately followed up . This is the moment for me to welcome the honour which has just been conferred on the United Nations and the Secretary-General by the award of the Nobel Peace Prize , which was just announced this morning . Indubitably this is a tribute and encouragement that cannot go unnoticed among Member States and I welcome it . Special emphasis needs to be given to a well-defined strategy for the maintenance and consolidation of peace . Here , as is often the case , the problem arises with regard to the measures to be applied to formulate both a policy and decisive action . We need to ensure that continuous attention is given to the report of the Working Group on the recommendations of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations approved by the Millennium Summit . In this respect I wish to recall , especially as regards Africa , the commitment contained in the Millennium Declaration “ To encourage and sustain regional and subregional mechanisms for preventing conflict and promoting political stability , and to ensure a reliable flow of resources for peacekeeping operations on the continent ” . ( A / RES / 55 / 2 , para . Moreover , with regard to disarmament , the first step would be to implement the commitment made in the Millennium Declaration , according to which the leaders of the world appeal for work towards the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and a reduction in the risk of small arms and landmines . There is thus urgency to speed up the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) . Moreover , the need to create a climate of trust between nations and to avoid a return to a nuclear arms race requires us to avoid any unilateral measures that could weaken and undermine the existing balance in the area of nuclear defence . The world today needs more than ever confidence-building measures and real will to act in concert . We need to reactivate the Conference on Disarmament so that it can finally adopt its programme of work and firmly take up serious negotiations on the issues before it in order to reach legally binding , irrevocable and verifiable agreements on disarmament . We welcome the holding of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects , which took place in New York from 9 to 20 July 2001 and which led to the adoption of a Programme of Action . To prevent , combat and eliminate the trade in these weapons such an objective would be strengthened if , on the one hand , States began to apply the principles recommended in the Programme and , on the other hand , a consensus could be reached on the outstanding issues . A rapid resumption of negotiations on these litigious items would certainly be an extremely significant initiative . My country has always accorded special importance to the debate in the Committee on issues vital to mankind . But today this interest is of special importance because of the domestic Congolese context and the Central African subregional environment . Indeed , emerging from a long period of civil war , which has caused countless loss of human life and huge material destruction , every national effort is centred on measures to consolidate peace , both inside and outside the country . In this context , in March and April 2001 a national convention took place designed to create a political consensus on the conditions to strengthen peace , democracy , and measures to reconstruct the national economy . At the same time we are pursuing , with the help of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) , a broad project for disarmament , demobilization and the reintegration of ex-combatants . In the context of that project , more than 20,000 ex-militia have been demobilized , 10,292 firearms have been collected , of which 6,500 have already been destroyed , and roughly 5,600 ex-militia are being assisted in reintegration through 1,496 micro-projects . We have taken steps with the United Nations Department for Disarmament Affairs and those groups interested in specific disarmament measures , in order to seek financing for the continuation of this vital project for the consolidation of peace in the Congo . This involves the establishment of a sustainable peace by integrating the ex-combatants in productive work and giving them new cause for hope , an alternative to resorting to violence . At the same time , in the context of the promotion of confidence-building measures at the subregional level , the Congo is actively participating in the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa . This is a particularly sensitive area in view of the convulsions in the Central African subregion and the Great Lakes over the last few years . We can easily understand why one of the recent Committee activities was to organize in Bujumbura from 14 to 16 August 2000 a subregional conference on the question of refugees and displaced persons within their own countries in the Central African subregion . The Advisory Committee has already adopted various important initiatives , namely the creation of the Council for Peace and Security in Central Africa ( COPAX ) and is establishing a Central African multinational force . There already exists a committee of those responsible for the police in Central African countries , who are in contact with each other and consult regularly on questions of common interest . At each of the ministerial conferences the committee examines the geopolitical situation in terms of security for member States . It also discusses cooperation between the States of the subregion in the various areas of security . At the bilateral level my country holds talks with all of its neighbours on the questions of peace and good-neighbourly relations . Agreements have been reached with Gabon , the Central African Republic , Angola , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo . With the latter we have just established an ongoing structure for cooperation in the field of security , that is , the organization of joint military patrols to monitor our joint border and to provide security for the people along the Congo and Oubangui rivers , which until recently were still the theatres of violent fighting and the massive displacement of peoples . My country is committed to the promotion of peace and sustainable development in Africa and throughout the world through a broad variety of measures . The most recent among them are the accession of Congo to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use , Stockpiling , Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction and a modest symbolic contribution to the United Nations Trust Fund for the Consolidation of Peace through Practical Disarmament Measures . That shows all the interest and hope that we place in the success of the work of the Committee to which an untimely event is giving exceptional importance . Mrs. Raholinirina ( Madagascar ) ( spoke in French ) : My delegation is happy to congratulate you , Sir , on your election to guide our work . I am persuaded that the Committee will fully benefit from your qualities , both professional and personal , and that under your guidance our deliberations will come to a successful conclusion . We also congratulate the other members of the Bureau . We also wish to pay tribute to the Department for Disarmament Affairs , under the leadership of Mr. Dhanapala , for its tireless efforts to promote the cause of disarmament . Our work takes place in a climate full of uncertainty after the terrible tragedy of 11 September 2001 , which will forever mark the history of mankind . In these trying times we wish to express our sincere condolences and deep sympathy to the people and the Government of the United States . I also take this opportunity to reiterate the strongest possible condemnation by the Republic of Madagascar of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations . By their very nature , terrorist acts are the clearest expression of the negation of the primacy of law and of the violation of fundamental human rights . Through its mandate the First Committee has a crucial role to play in efforts to be made to fight the scourge of terrorism which threatens international peace and security . The abominable acts committed on 11 September showed that terrorists are ruthless in the means they use and stop at nothing . The annual report of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) for 2000 is revealing in this regard . According to that document , terrorist and other groups could try to acquire nuclear material through theft . It is even more disquieting to learn from the report that the fight against the illegal trade in nuclear and radioactive weapons has increased due to the proliferation of such acts . The Secretary-General stressed this when on 1 October he told the General Assembly : “ The greatest danger arises from a non-State group , or even a private individual , acquiring and using a nuclear , biological or chemical weapon ” . In the face of this grave threat , Madagascar cannot but support the Secretary-General 's appeal for States to redouble their efforts to ensure the universality , verification and full implementation of key treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction . We also endorse his proposal for the tightening of national legislation over exports of goods and technologies needed to manufacture weapons of mass destruction . At any rate , in accordance with the Millennium Declaration , our ultimate objective must be a world free from weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons . History has shown that nuclear weapons are the most fearsome weapons ever invented by human beings . The risk of their use by terrorists only aggravates the threat posed by nuclear weapons to the survival of mankind . There is not a shadow of a doubt that for as long as there are nuclear weapons on our planet a world free from fear will be only a dream . In the area of nuclear disarmament , we regret the absence of tangible progress in making a reality of the unequivocal commitment of the nuclear Powers made at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) to completely eliminate their nuclear arsenals . Thus the hope raised by the positive results of that Conference has been replaced by concern . The inability of the Conference on Disarmament to agree on its agenda and begin negotiations on the fissile material cut-off treaty does not inspire us with optimism either . To this we must add the lack of sufficient progress in the universal ratification of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the delay in the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) . Other reasons for concern are the inability of the Disarmament Commission to agree on the holding of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , and the looming arms race in outer space . The many challenges that we face require that we renew our commitment to the cause of disarmament as a whole . The positive results achieved so far should encourage us to persevere and to redouble our efforts in this long and difficult enterprise . In this context , the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones in Africa , Asia and Latin America constitute a valuable step forward in the nuclear disarmament process . The creation of these zones , on the basis of agreements between the States of the region concerned should be encouraged , since it contributes to the strengthening of regional security and of mutual confidence among these States . Convinced that transparency favours the establishment of a climate of confidence , which is essential for lasting peace , Madagascar welcomes the increase in the number of States participating in the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms . We are in favour of any initiative to increase participation in the Register . Guided by its deep attachment to peace , in this year 2001 , which marks the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace , Madagascar would like to see a more active contribution by all the parties concerned in the search for ways and means to realize the fundamental objectives of that Declaration . The century that has just ended was marked by bloody conflicts , most of them fed by the proliferation of light weapons . The holding in July this year of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects was a historic occasion to agree on the development of a global strategy to fight this scourge . Despite its deficiencies in certain areas which are deemed essential by most delegations , including my own , the Programme of Action adopted by that Conference must be implemented as soon as possible in order to curb the devastating effects of light weapons . As the continent most affected by the phenomenon of the illegal trade in light weapons , Africa looks forward to meaningful signs of the speedy implementation of the Programme of Action , especially in the area of technical and financial assistance . The efforts of the African States in the fields of conflict prevention , conflict settlement and post-conflict peace-building deserve to be supported by the international community through the strengthening of the capacity of Africa for peace operations by equipping it with the necessary training and adequate means . Along the same lines , Madagascar hopes that the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa will become fully operational so that it can make an effective contribution to the promotion of peace , arms limitation and disarmament in the region . Like other developing regions , Africa has also known the agony caused by anti-personnel landmines , which cause unspeakable suffering to civilian populations , just as light weapons do . My delegation therefore welcomes the holding in Managua , from 18 to 21 September 2001 , of the Third Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use , Stockpiling , Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction . Madagascar hopes that this Convention will gain universal adherence , in order to put an end to the suffering of civilian populations , which are an easy target for this category of arms in times of war and in times of peace . Madagascar likewise deems it timely to establish in Africa a zone free of anti-personnel landmines . The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization notes the constant increase in global military expenditures recorded in certain industrialized countries and in various developing countries . This sombre assessment leads us to state that lasting security lies not in the accumulation of weapons , but in relations based on confidence and full respect for the noble objectives enshrined in the Charter . The close link between peace and development , which is an undeniable reality , makes more relevant than ever the need to allocate the colossal sums spent on the arms race to development efforts . The current situation requires a fresh look at our approaches and convictions regarding security . Our choice is clear : the narrow path of selfish national interest or the broader path of international peace and prosperity . My delegation hopes that at this very special session our choice will be guided by the voice of wisdom throughout our deliberations , in order to make this Committee an instrument capable of producing the drive required for the peace dynamic on which our common future depends . Mr. Kariyawasam ( Sri Lanka ) : May I at the outset felicitate you , Sir , and the other members of the Bureau , on your election . We are confident that your competence and in-depth knowledge of the issues that come within the purview of the First Committee will be invaluable in guiding a productive session . Let me also thank your predecessor , my friend Ambassador Mya Than , for his valuable contribution to the work of the First Committee as the Chairman at the last session . My delegation also wishes to express its appreciation to Under-Secretary-General Dhanapala and the officials of his Department , both here in New York and in Geneva , for their laudable work . It is all the more commendable since the Department for Disarmament Affairs is the smallest department of the United Nations Secretariat but is responsible for one of the main priority areas of the Organization . Let me also take this opportunity to congratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the United Nations Secretariat on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , which both Mr. Annan and the United Nations richly deserve . This year the First Committee is meeting for its annual assessment of international security and disarmament at a very crucial juncture . Our host country , in particular this city in which we are located , and the international community as a whole have witnessed a terrible human tragedy . We unequivocally condemn such terrorist attacks . Having experienced similar barbaric acts of terrorism , we in Sri Lanka very well understand and share the anguish and pain of those who have suffered from such acts of indiscriminate violence perpetrated on innocent civilians . Sri Lanka stands shoulder to shoulder with the United States and with the rest of the world to eradicate the menace of terrorism . While learning lessons from such tragedies , we need to reflect deeply on the necessary measures , some relating to the work of the Committee , to bring a sense of realism and purpose to our endeavours . There are quite a few issues in this regard on which we need to focus our attention . One primary measure is the urgent need to work together to create an international legal regime that encompasses all spheres of human activity and that would not allow , or would leave no room for , anyone to perpetrate acts of terrorism against innocent civilians . The taking of such measures should be the responsibility of all branches of the United Nations system . We could also assess what contribution or specific input , either directly or indirectly , the First Committee could make towards that objective . The question also arises of whether weapon-based security , which militarily powerful States seem to pursue , could bring security and peace for the inhabitants of those States . It has been assumed by some for a long time that the security of a nation-State could be assured by a weapon-based system of security with an array of weapons of mass destruction and attendant technologically advanced delivery vehicles . Such an impressive arsenal , it was calculated , would deter real and perceived enemies . Yet , even with such overwhelming military power , the ability to ensure physical security for all people in a State apparently remains elusive . Therefore , the quest for more advanced weapon systems does not appear to help much in ensuring human security . Moreover , the ability of non-State actors to lay their hands not only on small arms and light weapons but also possibly on weapons and means of mass destruction has emerged as a matter of grave concern . In this context we welcome the initiative taken by the Department for Disarmament Affairs to host a special symposium on terrorism and disarmament . We expect that the discussion in this forum will provide new insights into this important issue , and especially on how terrorism would impact on disarmament measures . Since the establishment of the United Nations 50 years ago , we have debated many theoretical perspectives on how best to achieve international peace and security that will benefit all the peoples of the world . We have discussed a range of theories , including the concept of common security , as well as the implications of the theory of mutually assured destruction , and several others . The Millennium Declaration adopted at the turn of this century by our heads of States underlined the axiom of peace and security with less armament and more cooperation . The Declaration also reiterated the often repeated desire of humankind for common security based on collective reliance , at both national and international levels . The hope was held out that countries would pause in their desire for increased weaponization and would even roll back ongoing programmes . It was natural for us to expect that such lofty ideals would percolate down towards the various United Nations disarmament and security forums such as this Committee and the Conference on Disarmament , and bodies for treaty review . However , it is apparent that developments since the Millennium Summit have led us in the opposite direction . International disarmament and arms control treaty systems have been challenged in many ways . Several treaty review mechanisms are becoming theatres for polemics . Treaties currently in force are contested for being outdated on the basis of unproven theories and technological abilities . The spirit and the purpose of some other widely adhered-to treaties are being violated because of a distinct lack of commitment for implementation measures by the parties to the treaties , and ill-motivated actions by those outside . The rule-based international conduct required to be observed under several treaty regimes is therefore being challenged . In this regard it is evident that the post-cold-war search by major Powers on how to achieve strategic balance or national security postures with or without nuclear weapons is not yet settled . That is obviously at the expense of a very large number of bystanders . All these developments do not bode well for our efforts in this Committee and elsewhere to achieve international peace and security . The most glaring victim of this retrograde trend is the Conference on Disarmament , in Geneva . That United Nations body , specially constituted for disarmament treaty-making , has tied itself in knots , resulting in a stalemate , primarily as a result of the strategic and tactical postures of some of its members . The Conference , touted as the world 's single multilateral negotiating forum for disarmament , remains inactive for the fourth year running . Neither the spirit of the Millennium Declaration nor the solemn commitment at the 2000 NPT Review Conference has had any positive effect in triggering meaningful action in the Conference on Disarmament . Sri Lanka is firmly convinced that the Conference on Disarmament should work towards the goals for which it was originally established . In this spirit , and as a manifestation of our commitment to make that forum useful again , I accepted the responsibility entrusted to me by the members of the Conference on Disarmament to coordinate the efforts of the Conference to find ways and means to ensure its improved and effective functioning . There were several other issues , such as expansion of the membership and agenda of the Conference that were discussed simultaneously . It was clear that an overwhelming number of the members of the Conference on Disarmament desire — and in fact are even ready — to change its rules of procedure with a view to making it more productive . During our deliberations several innovative ideas were discussed on how the Conference could be productive , pending the commencement of full-fledged negotiations towards specific treaty regimes . My delegation expects this process of consultation to continue at the next session of the Conference on Disarmament so as to arrive at concrete decisions . The objective of a world without nuclear weapons still remains as distant as ever . It is our earnest desire that this year will be the watershed in our quest for more resolute action towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons . This practically unusable weapon still remains in the armouries of several countries . There is also a likelihood that the number of countries in possession of such weapons will increase if the mystique and power status attached to them is not removed and a clear action programme established to eliminate them . At the same time , the endeavour of some countries to delink efforts for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons from those of nuclear disarmament is a matter of serious concern . Such an approach is not only preposterous but fraught with danger . The world will never be safe with a regime that would create permanent “ haves ” and “ have nots ” in nuclear weaponry . Such an arrangement is inherently unstable and unbalanced . History is full of failures of such projects in all fields of human activity , and in such instances the ultimate levelling-off has created major upheavals . Moreover , the perpetual existence of weapons of mass destruction , and arrangements at apparently managing them safely , are not only untenable and contradictory but could lead to unpredictable , disastrous consequences . In this regard we believe that the Secretary-General 's proposal for an international conference on eliminating nuclear dangers is a step in the right direction and should receive greater attention at this juncture . My country , together with Egypt , has had the honour for many years to bring to the attention of the Committee the issue of the prevention of an arms race in outer space . This is a manifestation of our often repeated belief that the last frontier of humankind , outer space , should remain peaceful as our common heritage and that this is vital for preserving stability and security on earth . However , our efforts to obtain consensus and to work towards concrete action on this issue have not yet produced results . The Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , which was first established by the Conference on Disarmament in 1985 and chaired by Sri Lanka in 1998 , has already examined and identified a number of important issues and proposals as well as a few initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space . The re-establishment of that Ad Hoc Committee by the Conference on Disarmament has the broad support of its members . However , differences persist regarding the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee . In this context we hope that the resolution on this subject in the First Committee this year will mark further progress towards our ultimate goal , and not a retreat from what has already been achieved . Despite the progress recently achieved at the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects , we remain deeply concerned that unless we take further resolute action the problem will remain as acute as ever . We congratulate Ambassador Camilo Reyes Rodriguez of Colombia on his invaluable contribution as the Chairman of the Conference and welcome the consensus Programme of Action that was adopted . However , it is our view that this modest achievement should not be considered as an end in itself . We expect the United Nations to play a major role in the implementation of the agreed measures and follow-up actions . At the same time , States and regional and international organizations , including the United Nations system , should continue to develop and support action-oriented research on this complex issue with a view to bringing forth other relevant and interconnected issues pertaining to the illicit transfer , manufacture and proliferation of small arms and light weapons , especially those that relate to non-State actors . Such efforts should focus on issues that were not adequately addressed during the preparatory process leading up to the Conference . In particular , brokering , tracing , and modes of conveyance should not be treated merely as law-and-order issues . In this regard , Sri Lanka welcomes the proposal made by the Rio Group of countries to hold a debate on the prohibition of the sale of small arms and light weapons to non-State actors . Moreover , in our view , the question of the supply of ammunition and explosives is an important related issue and should not be put on the back burner . After all , without ammunition a small arm becomes a primitive weapon , a stick . The difficulty and complexity of addressing some of these issues need not be an obstacle . Even at this hour more and more civilians are being killed indiscriminately by armed combatants and terrorists using small arms and explosives . In fact , if we are unable to monitor and control the production and transfer of sophisticated explosives , a vehicle such as a ship or an airplane could easily be converted into a weapon of mass destruction , with enough explosives packed into it . We deeply regret that the initiative aimed at establishing a protocol for verification and compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention ( BWC ) has ended in Geneva without final agreement . The credibility of international instruments such as the BWC , prohibiting weapons of mass destruction , depends to a great extent on the effectiveness of their verification regimes . The establishment of such verification regimes can be accomplished only through open and transparent multilateral negotiations . A more disturbing factor is that for the foreseeable future the BWC is likely to remain the only treaty dealing with a weapon of mass destruction that has no verification mechanism . The implications of this situation would certainly have adverse effects on the maintenance of international peace and security , particularly at a time when the international community is preparing to deal with the menace of terrorism . The growing threat of terrorism and the capacity of terrorists to use means of mass destruction such as biological and toxin weapons should not be overlooked or underestimated . It is apparent that international security perceptions and paradigms are in a state of flux at this moment . The promise of a peace dividend at the end of the cold war and at the onset of the twenty-first century has not been realized . In this context , we wish to emphasize the value of rule-based conduct for States and for their peoples . The evolution of strategic perceptions and the advent of new security paradigms should not undermine the existing sense of worldwide stability and security . New strategic visions and challenges , as well as threat perceptions , are best addressed in a multilateral context . Unilateralism should be avoided at all costs . Acts of terrorism that have caused unprecedented havoc in many parts of the world generate the need for a global compact on human security that will benefit both Member States of the United Nations and the peoples of the world . It is apparent that the security of a State does not necessarily translate into the security and well-being of a global citizen in a globalizing world . Only a rule-based system that is as robust and globally respected as that now operating in several other fields of human endeavour will have the capacity to assure international peace and security . We need to formulate and agree upon a rule-based system of security and conduct that will be respected by States , civil society and the global citizen . In this context my delegation expects that the First Committee deliberations will be a fruitful exercise and will engender a set of resolutions that will lend us strength to implement an effective programme of work in other security and disarmament forums , beneficial for all countries and all peoples . Mr. Castellón Duarte ( Nicaragua ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : At the outset , on behalf of my delegation , I wish to express my warmest congratulations to you , Sir , on your election to the chairmanship of the First Committee of the General Assembly for the present session . I am sure that thanks to your experience in the area of disarmament and your well-known diplomatic skills you will guide our work with great efficiency . We pledge the support of our delegation in your task . First , I wish to align myself with the statement made by the delegation of Chile on Monday , 8 October , on behalf of the Rio Group . The terrorist attacks of 11 September compel us to develop and implement new concepts that will guarantee national and international security . These cruel and violent terrorist acts make it necessary to increase our efforts for the control of armaments , for disarmament and for non-proliferation . These vile and perfidious acts have given rise to a coalition to fight terrorism , which constitutes a threat to global order and social coexistence . We reiterate our solidarity with the people and the Government of the United States of America . My delegation expresses its consternation over the continuation of the large-scale illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in the various regions of the world , including Latin America and the Caribbean . Small arms and light weapons have a set of characteristics that make them the weapons of choice in internal conflicts and in actions carried out by terrorist groups , insurgent forces , drug traffickers and irregular troops . Their main victims are invariably defenceless civilians . The Conference that was held in July this year is a major first step in the effective fight against this scourge that knows no geographic borders and that each year violates the human rights of millions of persons . The Programme of Action to prevent , fight and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects has a reasonable and broad approach to addressing the various problems associated with the diverse aspects of this trade at national , regional and global levels . Nevertheless , in the future we must make progress , especially regarding objectives that could not be adopted at the Conference , such as the control and sale of these weapons to non-State entities . The Conference on Disarmament , which is the sole multilateral negotiating forum for disarmament , was unable for the fourth consecutive year to agree on an agenda , which made it impossible to begin negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty for military purposes . We deem it necessary for the member States of that forum to act in good faith to eliminate the obstacles that stand in the way of its normal operation and , thus , progress in its work . We agree , and much more so after the events of 11 September last , that nuclear weapons are a permanent danger since there is a possibility that they could be used . The consequences of a nuclear attack can never be contained within the borders of a country or within the territories of the belligerent parties . Countries possessing nuclear weapons have a very important responsibility because of the damage that would be caused to innocent populations , especially in the case of an accident or , through neglect , their use by terrorists . Those countries must do everything in their power to prevent these dangers from becoming a reality . The conclusions of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) reaffirm the conviction that the full and effective implementation of the Treaty and the non-proliferation regime in all its aspects has a vital role to play in the promotion of international peace and security . Strict compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) is vital for the maintenance of global security and constitutes the unequivocal path towards the total elimination of nuclear arsenals . The 13 measures adopted last year by the States parties to the NPT must be implemented as soon as possible , especially by the nuclear Powers . My Government is firmly convinced that the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons , dated 8 July 1996 , continues to be of great importance in the area of nuclear disarmament . It clearly establishes that States have the legal obligation to carry out negotiations in good faith leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects and to conclude them as soon as possible . The delay in the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) is a source of concern to us , and we urge States that have not signed or ratified it to do so as soon as possible . One opportunity could be the forthcoming second Conference on the entry into force of the Treaty . According to the record , 13 ratifications are still necessary for it to enter into force , two of them by States that possess nuclear weapons . As a State party to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean ( Treaty of Tlatelolco ) , we support the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones in all geographic regions , since these constitute one of the most important advances made by the international community to promote confidence and a safer and more stable world . However , we must move even further along the road to disarmament since , as stated in the above-mentioned Treaty , although militarily non-nuclear areas make a decisive contribution to international peace and security , they are not an end in themselves but a means to achieve general and complete disarmament in a subsequent stage . The demining work in Nicaragua has made great progress in recent years thanks to a programme carried out by the Nicaraguan army with the support of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) and of the Governments of various friendly States that have cooperated by providing technical personnel and financing . These include the United States , Norway , Argentina , Denmark , Sweden , the United Kingdom , Spain , Brazil , El Salvador and Guatemala . At the end of the civil war of the 1980s more than 135,000 of these devices remained in Nicaraguan soil . About half of these mines have been destroyed by the army , which has demined more than 2 million square metres of the national territory . The southern border of the country has been declared free of anti-personnel landmines . According to Red Cross data , buried mines cause about 50 accidents each year ; 90 per cent of the victims are civilian , and of these 65 per cent are children and adolescents . Other sources indicate that more than 200 people have died in accidents caused by anti-personnel landmines , and the OAS states that more than 800 persons — women , men and children — have been incapacitated by explosions of mines and other explosive devices . About 130,000 mines remained in the warehouses of the army after the conflict . About 70,000 of these devices were destroyed before September this year . On the occasion of the Third Meeting of the States Parties to the Ottawa Convention , held in Managua , another 20,000 were destroyed . We hope that by 2004 the last mine will have been eliminated from Nicaraguan soil . On the other hand , we must mention that the demining commission in Nicaragua has emphasized the rehabilitation and social reintegration of the victims of mines , as well as the work of prevention and awareness in this regard . We know that a million mines are planted in 11 countries of Latin America , 110 million throughout the world , and their unexpected explosions kill or maim about 70 persons each day . The Third Meeting of the States Parties to the Ottawa Convention was held in Managua from 18 to 21 September in a world shaken by the barbaric terrorist attacks in the United States . Because of the attacks my Government could have chosen to change the dates of this Conference but , as announced by the Foreign Minister of my country at the inauguration of the Conference , that was not done for two basic reasons : first , because the meeting was of great importance for global peace and for the millions of citizens who live in countries where the scourge of anti-personnel mines represents a threat for old people , persons in the prime of life , and children ; and , secondly , because we did not want to give in to terrorism . We did not want ourselves to be cornered by these sinister and cowardly forces which seek to interrupt normalcy , paralyse us , and turn us into hostages of fear , all in the name of causes that are presented as noble objectives . By coming to Nicaragua , the delegates of more than 90 States gave a vote of confidence to peace , to the peaceful solution of conflicts and to civilization , and a resounding “ no ” to hatred , the law of the jungle and senseless and cowardly violence . The Declaration of Managua reaffirms among other aspects the unfailing commitment of the States parties to the Convention to the total eradication of anti-personnel mines and to deal with their treacherous and inhuman effects . It also calls on all States that continue to use , produce or acquire anti-personnel mines , to stop these activities at once . Those States that have stated their commitment to the purposes of the Convention must recognize that continued use of such mines was a clear violation of their commitment . We also welcomed the broad support achieved by the Convention through more than 120 ratifications and 21 signatures , including more than 40 States affected by mines . It was recognized that the new international standards established by the Convention were a milestone in its implementation , including the conduct of many States not parties to the Convention but which respect its provisions . Today , together with the delegations of Belgium and Norway , we will circulate a draft resolution entitled “ Implementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use , Stockpiling , Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction ” and we ask interested delegations , especially those from any State that is a party to the Convention , to co-sponsor it . We will soon present the draft to the Secretariat . Mr. Draganov ( Bulgaria ) : I should like to congratulate you , Sir , on your assumption of the chairmanship of the First Committee . I am confident that the diplomatic skills and the knowledge of disarmament issues you and the Bureau bring to the deliberations of the First Committee will facilitate the successful completion of our endeavours . Let me assure you , Sir , of my delegation 's support and cooperation in the discharge of your responsibilities . One issue has dominated the world 's attention over the past few weeks . We are still trying to come to terms with the horrible terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September . A tragedy of this scale does blow away a lot of illusions . A new look at hard realities is required and we are all being put to the test of where we stand and what we stand for . Clearly , new approaches to security , strengthening the non-proliferation and disarmament regimes and broad international cooperation are becoming even more essential in reducing the threats posed to mankind today . As demonstrated by the 11 September attacks , the unacceptable menace posed by terrorism requires from the international community an even more vigorous response and complex safeguards , particularly against any possible access by terrorists to weapons of mass destruction . Terrorism today is directed against the very foundations of human civilization and it is up to the whole of humanity to defend its values . We believe this Committee is highly relevant to the efforts to make our world a safer place . The Bulgarian Government and Parliament expressed its sympathy and solidarity with all the victims and their relatives from more than 80 countries and offered the United States Government its unequivocal support in undertaking the long struggle to fight terrorism . Bulgaria is proud to be an active member of the international coalition against terrorism . On behalf of my delegation I express to the members of the United States delegation our admiration for the courage and strength displayed by the American people in these trying times . At the beginning of the week , the representative of Belgium , Ambassador Jean Lint , delivered a statement on behalf of the European Union , the associated countries , and Norway . Ambassador Lint addressed the problems of international security and disarmament in a comprehensive way . Bulgaria has already aligned itself with that statement so I will only highlight some issues of particular importance for my delegation . As a candidate for NATO and European Union membership and an active member of the United Nations , Bulgaria has endeavoured to introduce top , international-standard export controls on foreign trade in arms and dual-use goods and technologies . A consistent and responsible policy in export controls remains a high priority task for my Government ; it is an essential element of our strategy for accession to NATO and the European Union , and an effective contribution to the global fight to counter international terrorism . Last April the Bulgarian Government decreed a consolidated list of countries and organizations to which the Republic of Bulgaria applies prohibitions or restrictions on the sale and supply of arms and related equipment . The list is in full compliance with United Nations Security Council resolutions and the relevant European Union and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) decisions . The control lists applied by Bulgaria effectively implement the unified and annually updated European Union lists for dual-use goods and technologies , the Wassenaar Arrangement munitions list in the field of the arms trade , as well as the lists of other multilateral and regional arrangements for non-proliferation . Recently , Bulgaria was officially admitted as a full member to the Australia Group . We value that membership as recognition of the non-proliferation policies pursued by Bulgaria and the efficient export control systems in place . Let me mention that while not yet a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) , my country unilaterally controls all the items placed on the equipment and technology control list of the MTCR . Bulgaria has declared its interest in becoming a member of the MTCR as well . The excessive and destabilizing accumulation of , and illicit trafficking in , small arms and light weapons help to aggravate ethnic and political violence , exacerbate human casualties and suffering , undermine post-conflict rehabilitation , and feed terrorism and organized crime . As an active Member of the United Nations Bulgaria adheres to the efforts of the international community to prevent and combat the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects . In fulfilment of our international commitments and the programme for restructuring the Bulgarian Armed Forces , the Ministry of Defence is carrying out projects for the destruction of existing small arms and light weapons surpluses . We are in close cooperation with a number of partners such as the United States of America , Canada , Great Britain , Norway , the Netherlands and others on a whole range of issues related to stockpile management and destruction of small arms and light weapons . In accordance with the Programme of Action adopted in July by the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects , more than 75,000 small arms are now being destroyed . Bulgaria is also an initiator of many subregional and regional efforts regarding small arms and light weapons in the framework of various forums and organizations , such as the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe , the European Union , the OSCE , the NATO / Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council working group on small arms and light weapons . The issue of eliminating the mine threat in our region has always been a high priority for my country . In October 1998 , Bulgaria proposed to the South-East European States a political commitment not to use anti-personnel mines and not to deploy them in areas adjacent to their common borders . Bulgaria ratified amended Protocol II to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects ( CCW ) on 4 November 1998 , thus contributing to the timely entry into force of this important international instrument . All obligations arising from that document have been strictly implemented ever since . An important milestone on the way to turning the region into an anti-personnel-mine-free zone was the Agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey , signed in March 1999 , on the non-use of anti-personnel mines and their removal from or destruction in the areas adjacent to the common border . A new step in this direction was the recent decision by the Turkish and Greek Governments to conclude a similar agreement , and simultaneously to adhere to the mine-ban Treaty . By the end of December 2000 , Bulgaria had demined all its minefields , destroyed its stockpiles of anti-personnel mines and became 100 per cent free of anti-personnel mines . Bulgaria reiterates its readiness to provide expertise and to participate actively in the destruction of anti-personnel mines globally . The Bulgarian specialized agencies have the capacity , as well as their own technology , to participate in such operations . We believe that the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe has the potential to pave the way for the establishment of an anti-personnel-mine-free zone in the region . Bulgaria will continue to work towards that goal . In view of the forthcoming Second Review Conference of the CCW , Bulgaria supports the efforts of the President-designate to coordinate work on the different proposals for further strengthening the CCW . We fully share all constructive contributions aimed at increasing the humanitarian effect of the Convention . In conclusion , allow me to express the hope of my delegation that the sense of unity and partnership shown by the international community in forming the new global coalition against terrorism will also serve as a guiding example and a source of inspiration in our debate on disarmament and international security .

Fifty-ninth session Item 11 ( b ) of the provisional agenda CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS , INCLUDING THE QUESTION Extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions Report of the Special Rapporteur , Ms. Asma Jahangir , submitted pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 2002 / 36 Addendum Mission to Honduras * * The executive summary of this mission report is being circulated in all official languages . The report itself is contained in the annex to the executive summary and is being circulated in the language of submission and Spanish only . Executive summary At the invitation of the Government the Special Rapporteur conducted a mission to Honduras from 5 to 15 August 2001 . The visit was mainly prompted by allegations of extrajudicial executions of a large number of children under the age of 18 , reported to have occurred mainly in the period 1998-2000 . The visit was aimed at allowing the Special Rapporteur to investigate these allegations in situ , and also to gather information and acquaint herself with other issues relevant to her mandate . In addition to studying issues pertaining to minors , during her mission the Special Rapporteur also received reports and heard testimonies regarding alleged killings of , inter alia , members of indigenous communities and political activists . Information regarding cases of persons who had allegedly been extrajudicially killed because of their sexual orientation were also shared with the Special Rapporteur . During her mission the Special Rapporteur held meetings in Tegucigalpa with a large number of government representatives , including the President of the Republic , the Minister for Foreign Affairs , the Minister of Public Security , the Attorney-General and the President of the Supreme Court . The Special Rapporteur also met with the National Human Rights Commissioner and the Executive Director as well as other staff of the Honduran Institute of Children and the Family ( IHNFA ) . She further held discussions with a number of representatives of civil society , including both local and international non-governmental organizations . Invaluable advice and support were provided by the United Nations Development Programme , the United Nations Children 's Fund and other members of the United Nations Country Team in Honduras . The Special Rapporteur also visited the city of San Pedro Sula , where she met , in addition to the city 's mayor , the Special Prosecutor Coordinator and the Chief of Police , as well as representatives of non-governmental organizations . The mission also included visits to juvenile detention centres in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula . Throughout her mission , the Special Rapporteur had discussions with both former and present members of youth gangs , the so-called maras and pandillas . In the streets of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula she also met a number of other youths and children , who told her about their lives , fears , plans and dreams . In her report the Special Rapporteur presents and analyses information gathered in Honduras describing a large number of alleged cases of extrajudicial killings of children and juveniles . The report also includes extensive case material based on a large number of interviews with eye-witnesses and family members of victims of extrajudicial killings . In her concluding remarks the Special Rapporteur notes that the material she collected and analysed for her report makes it clear that there have been a number of instances of children having been killed by the security forces . In most cases the child was unarmed and did not provoke the police to use force , let alone lethal force . There have been very few investigations or trials in incidents of extrajudicial killings , and convictions are exceptional . The Special Rapporteur further points out that the action taken so far by the Government has not delivered a clear message to the police that they will be brought to justice for abuse of authority or for human rights violations . Neither have powerful lobbies been apprehended or given a signal by the authorities that they cannot resort to murder under the pretext of trying to create a climate for economic revival . In this connection , the Special Rapporteur wishes to remind the Government that it is ultimately the human rights record , stability and rule of law in the country that will inspire confidence among donors and investors - not high-handedness and violence by the powerful against the more vulnerable members of society . The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Honduras to consider setting up an independent redress mechanism , such as an Ombudsperson for children . Such institutions are in place in a number of countries , and the Government of Honduras is encouraged to seek advice and support on this issue from other Governments and international agencies . The office of the Ombudsperson should have quasi-judicial powers and be provided with an independent investigative machinery . Amongst other functions , three are of primary importance : ( a ) The independent mechanisms needs to be mandated to receive and act upon individual cases of extrajudicial killing , which the competent authorities fail to register or prosecute . ( b ) It should keep a complete record of extrajudicial and other killings of children and monitor the progress made in the investigation and prosecution of each case . ( c ) It should be mandated to compile periodic reports , reflecting the work it has undertaken and publicizing the findings and recommendations it has presented to the Government . The Special Rapporteur further stresses that all killings of children must be thoroughly investigated . The Government must meet its obligation to solve the mystery of the children killed by unknown perpetrators . The Government should set up a Commission , with the participation of non-governmental organizations and the National Human Rights Commissioner , to study the situation with a view to formulating concrete recommendations and policy guidelines to ensure that these killings are thoroughly and independently investigated , and that those responsible are brought to justice without further delay . The Honduran media have a heavy responsibility in denouncing violence and demanding an end to impunity for extrajudicial killings of children . The media and government officials , especially those in higher authority must interact with , listen to and hear the voices of children before making decisions for children or formulating suppositions about them . The media in cooperation with the relevant authorities could play a crucial role in sensitizing the public and bringing about a culture of respect for the rights of children and adolescents , in particular their right to life .

Steps taken by the Government of Honduras 69 - 72 23 Introduction At the invitation of the Government the Special Rapporteur conducted a mission to Honduras from 5 to 15 August 2001 . The visit was mainly prompted by allegations of the extrajudicial execution of a large number of children under the age of 18 , reported to have occurred mainly in the period 1998-2000 . The visit was aimed at allowing the Special Rapporteur to investigate these allegations in situ , and also to gather information and acquaint herself with other issues relevant to her mandate . In addition to examining issues pertaining to minors , during her mission the Special Rapporteur also received reports and heard testimonies regarding alleged killings of , inter alia , members of indigenous communities and political activists . Information regarding cases of persons who had allegedly been extrajudicially killed because of their sexual orientation were also shared with the Special Rapporteur . The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Honduras for the cooperation and support extended to her and for its openness exhibited throughout the mission . While in Honduras , the Special Rapporteur was able to travel freely throughout the country and to meet with a wide range of individuals and gather information from a variety of sources without any impediment or obstruction . The Government was forthcoming in arranging all official meetings the Special Rapporteur had requested . She notes with appreciation , that the President of the Republic of Honduras , His Excellency Mr. Carlos Flores Facussé , took a personal interest in her mission and saw the Special Rapporteur during her visit . She was also pleased to have had the opportunity to meet with the First Lady , Mrs. Mary Flakes de Flores , to discuss her work providing aid and care for children in Honduras . Invaluable advice and support were provided by the United Nations Development Programme , the United Nations Children 's Fund and other members of the United Nations Country Team in Honduras . She is also grateful for the assistance given by non-governmental organizations . During her mission the Special Rapporteur held meetings in Tegucigalpa with the following officials and government representatives : the President of the Republic , the Minister for Foreign Affairs , the Minister of Public Security , the Vice-minister of the Preventive Police , the President and Vice-president of the Human Rights Committee of the Congress , the Vice-president of Congress , the President of the Foreign Affairs Committee , the Attorney-General , The Special Prosecutor Coordinator , the Special Prosecutors for Human Rights , for Childhood and the Handicapped , and for Organized Crime . She also had the opportunity to meet with the President of the Supreme Court of Honduras , as well as a number of other members of the Court . The Special Rapporteur also met with representatives of the Democratic Union Party and the National Party . The Special Rapporteur further met with the Executive Director and other staff of the Honduran Institute of Children and the Family ( Instituto Hondureño de la Niñez y la Familia , IHNFA ) . In addition , she also visited the juvenile detention centres “ Renaciendo ” and “ Corazon de María ” at Tamara , as well as “ Carmen ” in San Pedro Sula . In Tegucigalpa , the Special Rapporteur held two discussions with the National Human Rights Commissioner , Dr. Leo Valladares Lanza . She also met with representatives of the Honduran Bar Association . In Tegucigalpa she held briefings with a large number of local and international non-governmental organizations , as well as groups representing minorities and indigenous communities , including Casa-Alianza , Comité de Familiares de Detenidos Desaparecidos de Honduras ( COFADEH ) , Save the Children ( UK ) , Asociación Cristiana de Jóvenes , Consultorio Jurídico Popular , PRISMA , Proyecto Victoria , Asociación Visitación Padilla , Pastoral Social-Cáritas ( in Tocoa ) , Movimiento Campesino Aguán ( in Gualaco ) and Coordinadora de Organizaciones Populares del Aguán . While in Tegucigalpa , she also visited the premises of Casa-Alianza and a children 's cemetery managed by the same organization . In the capital the Special Rapporteur also spoke with a number of private individuals , including witnesses and relatives of victims of alleged extrajudicial execution . She also held a private meeting with a number of invited Honduran journalists . Internal discussions and briefing were held with the United Nations Country Team . She also met with the Acting Director of USAID . From 8 to 10 August , the Special Rapporteur visited San Pedro Sula , where , in addition to the city 's mayor , she held meetings with the Special Prosecutor Coordinator for San Pedro Sula and the Chief of Police . She also held discussions with the city 's judge for minors and juveniles . The Special Rapporteur was also briefed by a large number of non-governmental organizations including the Comité Interinstitucional para la Prevención y Rescate de los Jóvenes en Maras ( CIPREMA ) , Red Colaboración Siglo 21 , Pastoral Penitenciaria - Caritas , the Comité para la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos en Honduras ( CODEH ) - Santa Rosa de Copán , CODEH - San Pedro Sula , Comunidad Gay - San Pedro Sula and the Confederación Parlamentaria de las Américas ( COPA ) - Tocoa . She had the opportunity to speak with witnesses and relatives of victims of alleged extrajudicial executions . Throughout her mission , the Special Rapporteur had discussions with both former and present members of youth gangs , the so-called maras and pandillas . In the streets of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula she also met a number of other youths and children , who told her about their lives , fears , plans and dreams . She is grateful for their time and trust . The purpose of the visit Since her appointment , the Special Rapporteur has received information regarding extrajudicial killings of children in a number of countries . As the reported cases grew increasingly frequent , the Special Rapporteur decided to give the issue her full attention and to probe further in order to find more reliable and substantiated information . In view of these serious allegations , and in order to investigate this issue in situ , she decided that it was necessary to carry out a fact-finding mission to one country concerning which allegations of extrajudicial killing of children were regularly received . Honduras was selected also because of the commitment shown by the Government to address the issues concerning children . In this context it should be noted that the Committee on the Rights of the Child , in its concluding observations on the second periodic report submitted by Honduras ( CRC / C / 15 / Add.105 ) adopted at its twenty-first session , in August 1999 , stated , inter alia , that it was “ encouraged by the constructive , open and frank dialogue it had with the State party 's delegation and welcome [ d ] the positive reactions to the suggestions and recommendations made during the discussion ” . In its observations the Committee also took note of a number of positive steps taken by the Government , including the introduction of pertinent legislation . While the Special Rapporteur did not confine her investigation exclusively to the extrajudicial killing of children during her visit , that concern was central to the mission . Accordingly , she addressed all aspects of her mandate but placed greater emphasis on the violations of the right to life of children and devoted the biggest part of her mission to examining this regrettable situation . International human rights instruments to which Honduras is a party Honduras is a party to most of the key international human rights instruments , including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child . Honduras is also a signatory to the first and second Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . C. Political and socio-economic background Honduras has experienced a tumultuous political life , which in turn has impacted upon its social and economic conditions . The country was embarking upon an economic revival in 1998 when it was hit by Hurricane Mitch , which devastated the country . Thousands of people were killed and hundreds of thousands left homeless . Large portions of the country 's infrastructure were also destroyed . Throughout its history , Honduras has produced some remarkable personalities and leaders who , by their deeds , rose to become national heroes . The sixteenth century native leader , Lempira , resisted Spanish control over his region . There are several legends about his bravery and eventual death at the hands of Spanish soldiers . Today he symbolizes the country 's indigenous heritage , and the Honduran currency is named after him . Another admired leader , Francisco Morazón , was a self-educated man from Tegucigalpa . When Central America became independent from Spain in 1821 , Morazón joined the fight against the annexation of Honduras to Mexico . He lost the fight but subsequently joined the State Government of Honduras , part of the United Provinces of Central America formed in 1823 . Two years later he was appointed President of the Honduran State legislature , and in 1830 became President of the United Provinces . He challenged the power of the Roman Catholic Church in the period prior to the civil war . He was executed in Costa Rica in 1842 . A number of other illustrious Hondurans during the post-independence period provided the country with a rich legacy of fine role models . Civil war and conflicts led to the collapse of the United Province of Central America . The Honduran leaders were actively involved in seeking to preserve Central American unity but could not succeed . Since independence , there have been over 130 changes of government and several military engagements took place on the national territory . Some were encouraged by neighbouring countries or indirectly promoted by foreign multinational banana companies operating in Honduras . The people of Honduras experienced hard times between 1980 and 1984 , when State security forces carried out a systematic campaign of arbitrary detentions , torture , disappearances and extrajudicial executions . There is plenty of evidence of these atrocities , including the discovery of mass graves in 1981 / 82 . Testimonies given by officers involved in these incidents indicate that most of them were carried out by special counter-insurgency military units and the notorious “ Battalion 3-16 ” , a death squad under the command of military intelligence officials . The memory of Battalion 3-16 haunts Honduran society to this day . During the 1980s , Honduras also became the launching pad for the anti-Sandinist forces known as the Contras , who were fighting the Marxist Government of Nicaragua . The Contras were also allies of Salvadoran forces fighting leftist guerrillas . In 1993 , Dr. Valladares , the Honduran Human Rights Commissioner , requested the United States Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) to declassify a secret report of its Inspector General which confirmed the existence of politically motivated and officially sanctioned “ death squads ” . In 1995 , the Baltimore Sun published a series of articles which exposed human rights violations in Honduras in the 1980s , and human rights groups took up the demand for declassification . The CIA made the information available in 1998 . The lives of ordinary Hondurans still bear the scars of years of proxy wars and conspiracies . Despite this heavy legacy , Honduras is firmly pursuing a multiparty democratic political system . After two and a half decades of mostly military rule , a freely elected civilian Government came to power in 1982 . The Constitution came into effect on 20 January 1982 . The President is elected for a period of four years by universal and compulsory suffrage of citizens above the age of 18 . He / she is the Head of State and Government and appoints the Cabinet . A unicameral National Congress has 128 seats . Members are elected in proportion to the number of votes their party 's presidential candidate receives to serve a four-year term . The two main political parties , the Liberal Party and the Nationalists , have alternated in power . There are other political parties that have some presence in the country and are also politically active . The power of the military has been challenged by civil society and recently some gains have been made , but not enough so that civilians are free to make decisions which involve or affect the interests of the military . Prosecution of members of the armed forces for human rights violations are rare , and investigations into the military 's role in human rights abuses have been obstructed by the army . But the civil society continues to seek justice . In 1993 , the National Human Rights Commissioner released his report on disappearances , identifying security forces responsible for serious human rights abuses . The legislature has restricted the jurisdiction of military courts to military crimes committed by active-duty personnel and some successful prosecutions of police officers have occurred in civilian courts . The 1994 presidential candidate Roberto Reina of the Liberal Party won the election on the promise that he would implement economic reforms and protect human rights . He abolished the most dreaded State security agency ( DNI ) and replaced it with a civilian-controlled Directorate of Criminal Investigation ( DIC ) . Against tradition , he ignored the recommendation of the chief of the armed forces in appointing his Defence Minister . In recent years , Honduras has enacted a number of reforms which have contributed to a gradual demilitarization of society . In 1997 , the national preventive police force was placed under civilian control . By constitutional amendment in 1995 , compulsory military service was abolished . The minimum age for enlistment in the armed forces is 18 , and no under-age recruitment has been reported . The judicial branch of the Government is a subject of discussion in Honduras . There is consensus that reforms in this area are overdue . The system of justice was strongly criticized by almost everyone the Special Rapporteur met during her mission . The Supreme Court is the apex court and has nine principal justices and seven alternates . They are elected by the National Congress for a term of four years . The President of the Court is also elected by the National Congress . The powers and duties of the Supreme Court include the appointment of judges of subordinate courts and public prosecutors . It has the power to declare laws unconstitutional and to try high-ranking government officials when the National Congress has impeached them . At the local level , justice is administered by justices of the peace . Their jurisdiction is limited in civil and criminal matters . Justices of the peace handling criminal cases act as investigating magistrates and are involved only in minor cases . More serious cases are handled by the first instance courts , which serve as trial courts in civil and criminal cases . The judgements of this court can be appealed to the courts of appeal . A three-judge panel hears all appeals from the first instant court . The Attorney General 's Office is the key to the administration of justice and represents the interest of the State . Both the Attorney-General and the Deputy Attorney-General are elected by the National Congress for a period of four years . It has been strongly recommended by official commissions and various organizations that an independent Prosecutor General 's Office , with a separate investigative machinery , be created ; for the last seven years the Government has considered such a reform but little progress has been made . Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Latin American and Caribbean region . The economy , which is heavily dependent on agriculture , suffered a powerful blow from Hurricane Mitch in 1998 . The distribution of income is extremely unequal , with some 65 per cent of the population living below the poverty line . Honduras is also a young nation , with about 54 per cent of the population under the age of 18 . The literacy rate is around 73 per cent for the population as a whole . According to data provided by IHNFA , 27 per cent of Honduran homes ( 280,000 ) have a female head of household , a situation that generally tends to indicate poverty . Around 100,000 persons aged between 13 and 24 are heads of household ; 23 per cent of them are women . The formal sector of the economy employs approximately 29 per cent of the economically active population . The official unemployment rate is 40 per cent . Rapid urbanization and migration abroad in the last decades have also had a deep impact on the country 's economic and social development , especially in the larger cities . The HIV / AIDS epidemic is claiming a growing toll . An estimated 5,266 persons died of HIV / AIDS-related causes in 1999 in Honduras . The projected figure for 2005 is 6,400 . In addition to the immense human loss and suffering , this tragedy has had considerable economic and social costs . More than 70 per cent of the people dying of HIV / AIDS are between 15 and 49 years of age , i.e. the most economically active segment of the population . It is estimated that the number of orphans in Honduras will grow to 50,000-59,000 in the period 2000 to 2005 , and that 24-29 per cent of these children will be orphaned as a consequence of HIV / AIDS . The relationship between the Government and non-governmental organizations The Government of Honduras generally encourages the NGOs active in the country to carry out their mandates with freedom . However , like many other Governments , the authorities remain sensitive to the image of the country abroad . Human rights organizations are often blamed if embarrassing incidents or situations of human rights violations are brought to international attention . During the visit of the Special Rapporteur , many government officials expressed their distaste for organizations which were raising the issue of extrajudicial killings of children . The discomfort of the authorities was further aggravated by figures for extrajudicial killings that were published by a leading NGO . The figures included both children under the age of 18 and persons aged between 18 and 22 . The list gave the names of 606 persons who had allegedly been extrajudicially killed between 1998 and 2000 . ( The original list includes 614 names , but it appears that 8 names may have been repeated . ) Of the total of 606 individual cases , 368 , or some 61 per cent , were children ; the remainder were between 18 and 22 . The figures indicate that 55-64 per cent of the victims were killed by unknown persons and 5-9 per cent by law enforcement agents . About 19-23 per cent were killed by civilians . In 2000 some 19 per cent of the killings were attributed to gangs , 6 per cent in 1998 and 7 per cent in 1999 . In this context the Special Rapporteur wishes to note that under her mandate the term “ extrajudicial killing ” is generally understood to mean killings resulting from action or omission on the part of the State authorities . However , the mandate also covers the issue of impunity for killings attributed to State agents or non-State actors . The Special Rapporteur further wishes to emphasize that her mission , which was carried out at the invitation of the Government , was by no means motivated or prompted by information and allegations received through any single source . Prior to and during her mission , the Special Rapporteur received information of extrajudicial killings of children through a number of sources and , as this report will reveal , the situation is grim . At the beginning of the visit , there was apparent confusion among government officials in comprehending the specificities of the Special Rapporteur 's mandate . At the Ministry of Public Security and the Attorney-General 's Office the Special Rapporteur was given figures for crimes , rather than extrajudicial killings . She was briefed about the socio-economic background of the minors killed by the security forces or other persons . However , there was no emphasis on the profile of the perpetrators and no clear information regarding the status of trials or investigations . Thus , the killing of juveniles was regarded and presented as primarily a question of poverty and juvenile delinquency . The entire emphasis was on the prevention of juvenile delinquency , with little thought given to finding means of preventing extrajudicial killings . A number of key government officials concentrated on disputing the specific numbers given by an NGO of extrajudicial killings of children , rather than addressing the issue itself . The Special Rapporteur is further dismayed that government officials often appeared to find comfort in demonstrating that the numbers of human rights violations were lower than claimed by an NGO . She wishes to emphasize that every single incident of extrajudicial killing deserves the attention of Governments , even more so if the victim is a child . During her mission , she received strong indications that extrajudicial killings of children were far more numerous than those documented by the Government . Throughout the mission random interviews with children revealed more and more cases of such killings . The Special Rapporteur was constantly reminded by high-ranking officials that Honduras was not the only country where children were targets of extrajudicial killing . This reality , of which the Special Rapporteur is well aware , does not and should not be seen or presented as a mitigating factor by any Government . The number of children killed by security forces is increasing , and the number of countries where such violations are reported is also on the rise . At the end of her visit the Special Rapporteur had the privilege of discussing the situation of extrajudicial killings of children with the President of Honduras , Mr. Carlos Flores Facussé . She was pleased at his positive and constructive response . He sincerely promised to order a deeper study of the problem and to take preventive measures . The Special Rapporteur was also reassured by the commitment shown by the Human Rights Commissioner , many NGOs and the United Nations bodies in protecting the right to life of the people , especially the children .

The maras connection Following the visit of the Special Rapporteur , the Permanent Mission of Honduras to the United Nations Office at Geneva sent a report dated 11 September 2001 , entitled “ Preliminary report on violent deaths among adolescents in Honduras ” , prepared by IHNFA . The report solidly and categorically links cases of extrajudicial killing of children with the overall occurrence of juvenile violence and the economic deprivation in Honduras . The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress that this supposed connection is misconceived . While disempowerment makes children vulnerable and exposes them to abuse and crime , juvenile delinquency can never be used as a justification for the killing of children by the security forces in the name of maintaining law and order . Undoubtedly there are violent gangs of children in the country , also known as maras or pandillas , but extrajudicial killings with impunity by security forces cannot be excused because of the existence of such groups . The killing of children by unknown perpetrators is routinely attributed to inter-gang wars between the maras . It is alarming that a section of the Honduran press often demonizes street children and blames the high level of violence in the country on child gangs . These journalists further fuel the hate speech practised by some high-ranking politicians and business leaders who deliberately incite public sentiment against street children . In this way violence against and even the killing of these children is trivialized and encouraged . In the end , every child with a tattoo and street child is stigmatized as a criminal who is creating an unfriendly climate for investment and tourism in the country . The Special Rapporteur was told of a particular television show which regularly used hate speech against the maras . Its message was that they deserved to be removed and cleansed from society . She met a traumatized young man of about 15 , Jeffrey Gamboa , who said that he had been picked up by the police in late July 2001 and forced to appear in a television programme “ TV 30-30 ” , displaying his tattoos . According to Mr. Gamboa , the notorious “ Chinaman ” ( a police officer feared by all street children ) accompanied by other police stormed into his house and took him at gunpoint to the television station , where a journalist interviewed eight children . The witness insisted that he was threatened with death by the police if he did not say what he was told to say before the cameras . Out of the eight boys appearing on the programme , three were allegedly killed by unknown persons within a few months of the broadcast . Jeffrey Gamboa was being given physical protection by a local NGO , which confirmed that the three children had indeed been mysteriously killed and that they feared for the life of Jeffrey Gamboa . Some independent journalists the Special Rapporteur met with were deeply disturbed by what they described as “ the criminalization of poverty ” and the media making crimes against children respectable . The myths surrounding the lives of the maras are presented in such a way as to constitute a virtual licence to the security forces and other vested interests to kill street children . These are children who are already victims of a political , economic and social system which is robbing them of their childhood and youth . The poverty and injustice that surrounds them is the result of a harsh and irresponsible political system they are being forced to inherit . The Government of Honduras acknowledges that crime amongst children constitutes 5 per cent of all crimes and misdemeanours recorded in the country . A study conducted in 1999 by IHNFA , with the support of UNICEF , showed that 0.02 per cent of all murders committed in Honduras were attributed to children . Nevertheless , government officials and the media insist upon laying the entire blame for the bulk of all crimes on street children . They repeatedly try to give the impression that the majority of the children killed were casualties of gang wars , which is incorrect and leads to false conclusions . The official record shows that in the first six months of 2001 , 66 minors were killed . Human rights organizations put the number higher . The vast majority of these cases remain unresolved and the perpetrators are unknown . The Government confirms that more than half of the reported killings of children remain unsolved . NGOs suspect that these killings cannot be carried out without official patronage ; the numbers are too high for them not to be orchestrated and planned . The information available suggests that these killings could indeed be carried out by groups or individuals , operating with or without official patronage . Regardless of the identity and connections of the perpetrators , the Government bears a responsibility to investigate and solve the killings . They are rightly expected to make concentrated and serious efforts to identify the source of the killings and to protect the public from further violence . So far the efforts have been lukewarm and have not addressed the atrocities in a serious and responsible manner . There are several youth gangs in Honduras . Dominant among them are the “ Mara Salvatrucha ” ( better known as the MS ) and the “ 18 ” gang , which is named after 18th Street in Los Angeles . The Office of the Secretary for Public Security in Honduras claims that over 31,000 youngsters belong to gangs . A quarter of them are females . NGOs put the figure much higher . The gangs operate throughout the country but are more visible in the urban centres of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula . A youth gangs culture has existed in Honduras for decades , but in recent years children have imbibed the culture of violence around them , and at the same time their abject neglect has made gang life seem more attractive as a source of security and as a community to which they can feel attached . The Special Rapporteur interviewed several children , including members of maras , many of whom had witnessed the extrajudicial killing of their friends in the streets or in custody . During these discussions she felt a great sense of remorse , as many of the children had hopes and aspirations for a better life . The children interviewed by the Special Rapporteur reported that any child who became a “ Christian ” could safely leave the gang without fear of reprisal . Two such children had left the gang life and were being supported by NGOs and Church members to pick up the threads of normal life . The children were being protected because of fears for their safety . The Special Rapporteur met a juvenile judge in San Pedro Sula , who showed her a number of chimbas ( primitive handguns ) made by gang members , or mareros . The judge regretted that the talents of the children were being used for their own destruction , when the same creative energy could help to build Honduran society . The mareros are armed mostly with chimbas , though some of them manage to lay their hands on sophisticated weapons . A number of children admitted that they get ammunition from the armoury run by the military to provide pensions for retired soldiers . The Special Rapporteur visited the armoury to verify these allegations . She found that while records were kept for every weapon that was sold , there were no records of purchasers of ammunition . Mareros come from the most disadvantaged sections of society . Almost 8 out of 10 children interviewed by the Special Rapporteur came from a single-parent family - the mother being the sole parent in each and every case . The IHNFA report referred to above describes a typical profile of a marero in the following manner : “ An adolescent or young person , usually male , living in a poor district ; the child of relatively poor parents , reproducing his parents ' conditions of poverty and deprivation in a second generation . Like his parents , as a general rule he has a low level of school achievement , and works in unskilled , relatively low-paid jobs . In general , it can be said that mareros have grown up in homes that are materially and emotionally deprived in a number of ways … The marero or pandillero is , generally speaking , an adolescent or youth characterized by academic failure … Rejected by the formal education system which offers career prospects , their desire to succeed makes them suitable candidates for technical vocational training that would enable them to become productive members of society . Adolescents and youths who are gang members spend a good deal of time in the street . What prompts them to join the world of gangs is a desire for social identity , for pleasure and hedonism , companionship and the feeling of power and social recognition that comes from being a member of a group that affords protection , support and social visibility … During the gang socialization process , adolescents and youths have many opportunities to sample drugs and the life of crime that is a result partly of the need to obtain money for drugs and partly the effect that drugs have … on their own humanity . ” The gangs fight one another other for territory . Every gang has its own sign language , slang , style of dressing , haircut , and music or sound tracks . These symbols define their identity and confirm their bond to the gang . Children are generally not physically forced to join gangs , but peer pressure along with other social factors attract them to gang life . Once they become members , they enter a harsh life where violence and drugs ( mostly low-priced drugs and glue ) play an important part . They go by their nicknames and are organized by the name or numbers of their streets . The most respected gang member is the “ Mister ” , who has “ earned ” the title through his acts . In one particular discussion , the status of the “ Mister ” was made clear to the Special Rapporteur by young mareros who , in response to her questions about their “ leadership ” , rolled their eyes in admiration while introducing a “ Mister ” , who shared the same room in the detention centre with the others but kept his distance to maintain his status . Some Honduran children wear tattoos . Gang members are specially required to do so by their peers , as the tattoo identifies the gang they belong to . Each tattoo has a story , a symbolic meaning or a saying behind it . A teardrop signifies the death of a “ buddy ” . A cobra shows the position of the gang member . These tattoos represent the gangs to the outside world , and every child who has one , whether or not he or she belongs to a gang , is hunted down , by the security forces or other unknown persons . An NGO has acquired a tattoo-removal machine and several children have taken advantage of it . However , in the end it is not tattoo-removal machines or NGOs that can protect children from being gunned down . Their protection has to be guaranteed by the State , which must ensure that the present de facto blanket impunity for the killing of marginalized children in Honduras ends without delay . Girls are also gang members . Some of them explained that they are expected to “ get tough ” when they become members . They are beaten and roughed up by their male peers . They are specially vulnerable , but easier to extract from gang life . In the male detention centres members of different gangs were kept apart . Each gang was confined to its own ward , as gang animosity continued unabated . The Special Rapporteur was encouraged to observe that the girls , on the other hand , mixed easily . Their sisterhood had transcended the boundaries of hatred and violence . Voices of the children The Special Rapporteur was overwhelmed , disturbed and distressed after the several meetings she held with children in Honduras . Many were mareros , others were not . What they all shared was the poverty and insecurity that stems from social , political and economic injustice . The Special Rapporteur is conscious that millions of children around the world suffer under similar circumstances . This is an alarming situation and does not bode well for the future of any society . The child population in the many countries of the developing world is increasing . Children outnumber adults , and yet their future is not secured . A large number of children are neglected , ignored and marred by violence at a very early age . They have better access to arms and narcotics than to books and knowledge . They live in the street rather than in a home , and rough experiences in place of a childhood . There must be a general realization that street children , or for that matter poverty in all its manifestations , are not “ a necessary evil ” . Poverty has a cure , which requires patience , sincerity and sound planning . Above all it requires the political will and courage to eradicate poverty through an effective programme built on justice for all . In particular , an appropriate level of resources has to be spent , and economic justice for children calls for new thinking in the way budgets are planned . None of the children interviewed by the Special Rapporteur asked for mercy , charity or help . What they wished for was to live in dignity and security : they were calling out for a chance to enjoy their rights as children . While each of the discussions was unique and often impressive , some of the stories the children told stand out as particularly symptomatic and illustrative of their everyday hopes , fears and aspirations . Here , the Special Rapporteur would like to share some of the words that have stuck in her mind : “ I want to make my mother proud . ” “ Get the `Chinaman ' out of our lives , I don 't want to die in the mountains . ” “ I want to take off my tattoo , but I need my friends . ” “ No one cares for us , they are all too busy . ” “ I want to become a technician , so that I can help my mother . ” “ Our motto is : `My friend , live for your mother and die for your hood ' . ” “ I want to go to the USA as there is nothing here for me . ” “ I want to study and be in school . ” “ I want to leave this life of misery and live peacefully without fear . ” “ I want peace with the police . ” Alleged extrajudicial killings of children and juveniles Prior to her mission , in the year 2000 the Special Rapporteur formally submitted 47 individual cases of alleged extrajudicial executions by the police to the Government of Honduras . In 29 of these cases the victim was said to be under the age of 18 . While on mission , the Special Rapporteur resubmitted the cases she had sent to the Government in 2001 by a letter addressed to the Minister for Public Security . She wishes to take this opportunity to relate some of these allegations of extrajudicial killings , as an illustration of the situation . In the last few years , the Special Rapporteur has been informed of and acted upon several cases where minors were said to have been killed as a result of excessive use of force or blatant neglect and denial of medical care by law enforcement officials . In a letter addressed to the Minister for Public Security of 6 August 1999 , the Special Rapporteur raised the case of Alexander Obando Reyes , 17 years of age , who was allegedly killed by police in April 1999 . It was reported that Reyes was in a park in Tegucigalpa together with a friend when , at around 10 p.m. , a police officer appeared and opened fire , injuring Reyes in his abdomen and chest . Reyes allegedly died the following day at hospital . It was reported that the police officer implicated had not been arrested and prosecuted for this act . In the same letter , the Special Rapporteur also referred to the case of Edy Nahum Donaire Ortega , 17 years old , who died after having been shot by police officers on 21 January 2000 . It appears that Ortega had been arrested and was being taken back to the police station after having appeared before a court , when he escaped . A police officer reportedly apprehended Ortega , who was unarmed , and shot him in the leg . He allegedly died from loss of blood , as the bullet had severed an artery . It appears that the police officer concerned was detained and was awaiting trial . However , there were allegations that the investigation into the case had been technically inadequate and deliberately slow . In her letter the Special Rapporteur asked for an update on this case . The Special Rapporteur also raised the case of Francisco Javier Espinoza , 17 years of age , who allegedly died in police detention in Tegucigalpa on 28 January 2000 . It is reported that on 28 January Espinoza had tried to rob a bus , when he was assaulted by a passenger who beat him with a metal tube , resulting in severe head injuries . It is alleged that after having been briefly detained at police post No. 6 in Colonia Kennedy in Tegucigalpa , Espinoza was taken into custody at regional police station No. 1 . It is reported that he did not receive any medical attention , despite severe bleeding from his head injuries . After having been held in his cell for some eight hours , Espinoza allegedly went into convulsions . Police officers apparently put him in the back of a pick-up truck and took him to the Teaching Hospital , where medical staff reportedly refused to treat him , stating that he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol . Espinoza died on his way back to the police station . While it appears that investigations have been carried out into this case , it is not known whether anyone has been held responsible for the negligence that caused the death of the victim . In relation to the deaths of Alexander Obando Reyes , Edy Nahum Donaire Ortega and Francisco Javier Espinoza , the Special Rapporteur wishes to make reference to the following international human rights instruments , which are of particular relevance in these cases . Under principle 9 of the Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials , “ Law enforcement officials shall not use firearms against persons except in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury , to prevent the perpetration of particularly serious crime involving grave threats to life , to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority , or to prevent his or her escape , and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives . In any event , intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life ” ( emphasis added ) . Furthermore , under article 6 of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials , “ Law enforcement officials shall ensure the full protection of the health of persons in their custody and , in particular , shall take immediate action to secure medical attention whenever required . ” Prior to her mission , on 18 June 2001 , the Special Rapporteur submitted the following allegations of extrajudicial killings to the Government , with a request that she be informed of any investigations undertaken with a view to bringing the perpetrators to justice . According to the information received , on 25 May 2001 the dead bodies of Cinthia Valeska Rivera , 14 years of age , and another juvenile of 15 were discovered near El Estiquirin in Comayaguela in Tegucigalpa . It was reported that the two girls had been shot in the head after having been raped . The identity of the perpetrator or perpetrators was unknown . On 6 August 2001 , the Government replied , stating that the case was being investigated and adding that preliminary police investigations into the case of Cinthia Waleska Rivera suggested that the girl might have been killed by members of the “ 18 ” gang . Throughout her mission , the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to listen to testimonies of persons , including many children , who alleged that they had personally witnessed extrajudicial executions . She also met with family members of victims of such killings . Their stories largely supported earlier reports of extrajudicial killings conveyed to the Special Rapporteur . While many testimonies did not shed much light on the identity of the perpetrators of the majority of the cases under scrutiny , other incidents related to her were attributed to uniformed police officers . The children in detention centres reported a number of cases where they had seen the police kill another child . One out of four children in these centres related incidents of extrajudicial killings of children witnessed by them . In Tegucigalpa , the Special Rapporteur talked to two adolescents , around 16 years of age , who said they had witnessed the same incident . According to their testimonies , on 20 June 2001 , at around 11 p.m. , they were rehearsing with their rap-group in a neighbour 's house when several police officers forcibly entered the house . The police allegedly grabbed two of the teenagers and dragged them out of the house , and told them to run and never come back . When they started running , one of the police officers reportedly opened fire . It is alleged that three bullets hit one of the boys in the head and he was killed instantly . The other teenager managed to escape . However , when other police officers came to pick up the body , they reportedly apprehended the other boy , held a gun to his head and threatened to kill him if he reported that his friend had been shot by the police . Allegedly , the investigative police refused to take up the case and blamed the killing on the gangs . On 20 July 2001 , in the Sipile neighbourhood , Comayaguela , Juan Ramón , aged 16 , José Germán Coello Madina , aged 15 and Miguel Angel Mendoza , aged 18 , were allegedly approached by a National Preventive Police patrol with the registration No . One of the policemen wore the name-tag “ Sanchez ” . The police allegedly asked for documents from the three youngsters and threatened them , upon which Juan Ramón started to run , as he had previously been badly wounded by the police . According to the other two eyewitnesses , the police opened fire on Ramón just as he was about to turn a corner . The police refused to take the injured boy to hospital , and he later died of his injuries . A case was registered but at the time no one had been arrested . On 7 April 2001 , José Giovanni Lainez , 17 , was sitting on a stone outside his school when he was approached by police officers , who ordered him to stand up . As he did not do so , the police reportedly opened fire . The bullets hit his leg and he was taken to the hospital by the police . His family was not allowed to see him , nor were they informed by the hospital authorities that he had been removed from the hospital by the police through a back door . The boy 's mother was told that her son was alive when he left the hospital . Later she was handed her son 's body with a clear bullet wound between the eyes . She appealed to police authorities to arrest the killers . Her pleas went unheard and she was ridiculed at every step she took to secure justice . The mother knows the names of her child 's killers and she carries her son 's photograph with a crumpled paper relating to the incident next to her chest , in search of justice . The mother of Oscar Daniel Madina Córtez , age 16 , recounted her agonizing experience . Oscar Córtez and two other friends , one of them identified as José Luis Hernández , aged 14 , were returning home on bicycles when they were stopped by a police car around 6.30 p.m. on 11 January 1998 near a square in San Pedro Sula . Hernández escaped and informed Córtez 's mother of the incident . She panicked , and went to plead with the police to spare her child . She was told to look for him in the cane fields or to wait at home and listen to the news on the radio . In the middle of the night Mrs. Córtez 's neighbour informed her that she had received a phone call to say that the car in which her son was kidnapped was spotted by people in the area . Mrs. Córtez again went to the police , who drove her around in search of the car but could not find it . The next day the neighbours informed Mrs. Córtez that the police had called to say that her son 's body and that of his friend had been found in a banana field . Their skin had been pierced and their genitals cut off . One of them had a bullet between the eyes and another in the back . Mrs. Córtez said that she had tried to file a complaint against the unknown police perpetrators but was not able to do so . Moreover , no one was willing to come forward to give evidence . Numerous witnesses claimed to have seen policemen deliberately and without provocation kill children belonging to the economically disadvantaged sections of society : Chico said that he saw his neighbour , a 14-year-old , killed by police driving in a car without a licence plate . The boy had come out of the house to see his friends . As he stood by his door he was shot . His mother came running out and saw her dead son on the doorstep . Nobody was willing to appear as a witness to the incident . A taxi driver had complained to the police about the neighbourhood children who regularly threw stones at his taxi . The police accompanied him to the spot and opened fire , killing by mistake the son of the taxi driver . On 20 June 2001 , Sara Alvarado took her daughter to the hospital , where her neighbour followed her to inform her that her son , Juan Ramón Antunes Alvarado , had been shot dead by the police . Juan studied at a private technical school and was not associated with any of the gangs . Mrs. Alvardo said that a number of people had witnessed the incident . They said that the police had cornered three boys and opened fire , killing her son , while the other two miraculously survived . An eyewitness described to the Special Rapporteur how on 7 April 2001 , Cristián Lizandro Ramírez Diaz , aged 18 , and Wilmer Alfredo Romer were assaulted and killed by two policemen . The Special Rapporteur also spoke to Wilmer Alfredo Romer 's mother who corroborated the witness 's testimony . The two boys lived in the municipality of Potrerillos , Cortes , and were killed in the presence of their friend Iván Canales , who managed to escape . According to Canales , the three were sitting in his parked car at around 3 a.m. when two policemen forced them at gun-point to drive towards Pimienta municipality . As they crossed the intersection of Campo Blanco the police ordered them to stop the car , get out and lie on the ground on their stomachs with their arms in front of them . They were allegedly shot several times in the head . Canales managed to run away . A complaint was lodged against the accused policemen . One of them has not yet been arrested . The second policeman was arrested , but the trial has not yet started . Witnesses also gave accounts of groups of armed men in civilian clothes driving around in unmarked vehicles . The men were said often to wear masks and use new and sophisticated automatic rifles . There were repeated allegations that these groups had on several occasions forcibly apprehended and abducted children or youths , who were never seen again . Witnesses further claimed that the police failed to take action to apprehend these persons , and at times actively covered up their activities . Some observers drew parallels between these groups and members of the notorious Batallion 3-16 . There were some common elements in most testimonies heard by the Special Rapporteur . The alleged killers usually drove vehicles , often pickup trucks , without number plates and with tinted windows . Dead bodies of street children killed by unknown perpetrators have been found in deserted areas in the hills and mountains outside the cities . The children appear to have often been tortured before being shot between the eyes . Every child the Special Rapporteur talked to in Tegucigalpa alleged that the “ Chinaman ” was the key person behind these human rights violations . Apparent in all the testimonies was the utter distrust and pervasive fear of the police among disadvantaged children and their families , which is kept alive by impunity and indifference . In such a climate it is difficult even for local NGOs and human rights defenders to document cases of extrajudicial killings . This is especially true in the case of children , who can easily be silenced . The Special Rapporteur realized during her mission that the data gathered and reported by NGOs merely indicated a trend and , as many of them suggested , appeared to be only the tip of the iceberg . B. Impunity Investigations were hardly ever carried out in the large number of cases of children killed by unknown perpetrators . The Attorney-General 's Office briefed the Special Rapporteur regarding two lists of children killed . The office was reviewing 235 cases of the 606 cases identified by NGOs ( see para . Of these , 25 cases were in the preliminary trial state , 6 were at the sentencing stage and in 2 cases the trials had concluded ; persons had been arrested in 16 cases . All these incidents had occurred before December 2000 . The other cases were either being examined or the prosecution had been dropped . Data provided by NGOs indicate that 61 per cent of the cases were never investigated . The victims were not heard and , despite their insistence , their statements were not considered . Two witnesses of two different incidents told the Special Rapporteur of dead bodies of children found in the streets in the morning . According to the witnesses , the bodies were later removed by the police but no report of the murders was made available . Other reports submitted by NGOs allege that in three separate instances no report of a killing was made in police records after five dead bodies of children shot by unknown persons were recovered . The Special Rapporteur met at least 10 families of victims who complained that whenever they approached the police , they were not listened to ; on the contrary , they were jeered at for daring to pursue the matter further . While relating their encounters with the police , two mothers began to cry bitterly at the humiliation and hurt they had suffered and the helplessness they experienced during their period of grief . There was a widespread belief that many of the unidentified killers of children were either members of the security forces themselves or private guards who operated under the patronage of the security forces . The Human Rights Commissioner told the Special Rapporteur that such suspicions were “ well founded ” , as the pattern of such killings and subsequent cover-ups could only be carried out with the support of the authorities . He was hopeful of seeing a more transparent system as he sensed a change in attitude , but was also mindful of the resistance by vested interests who saw street children as an obstacle to economic development in the country . At the same time , the Commissioner was also acutely aware that public opinion was turning increasingly aggressive against street children . In this connection , the Special Rapporteur wishes to note two specific cases which were brought to her attention , which clearly illustrate the prevailing climate of indifference and impunity in relation to killings of children . Alexander Joval Villatoro , a taxi driver , told the Special Rapporteur that he was taking two passengers to Capcamo when a police officer , who was out of uniform , insisted on riding with the other passengers to the destination . Near Capcamo the policeman asked the taxi driver to stop at the roadside where three boys were waiting for him . The policeman spoke angrily to the boys and asked them why they had run away . He seized the oldest by the shirt and pulled at him roughly . At this point the driver became frightened and drove off . The next day he heard on the news that three boys had been killed at the spot where he had dropped off the policeman . The taxi driver and a female passenger who was with him testified against the policeman , who was arrested . Since then there have been four attempts on the life of Mr. Villatoro , and he has been threatened by the family of the accused policeman . Several months after the incident Mr. Villatoro was arrested and sent to jail on charges of drug-related offences . Finally , on 5 August 1999 , he was acquitted and released but he still lives in fear . He told the Special Rapporteur that he had moved house several times and was not able to testify against the accused policeman . Antonio Ramón Calero , aged 17 , was reportedly arrested on 24 November 1999 by the Criminal Investigation Department ( DGIC ) on charges of robbery and causing of injury . The next day he was to be produced before the juvenile judge , but owing to non-availability of staff , he was taken back to the DGIC . According to the information received , Calero tried to escape and jumped out of the vehicle . He was allegedly shot and 10 days later he died of his injuries . No inquiry or investigation was reportedly carried out . In the beginning of the mission , the Minister for Public Security briefed the Special Rapporteur about the root causes of extrajudicial killings on the presumption that the mandate of the Special Rapporteur included all forms of killings . The Minister was very critical of parents of street children whom he described as “ irresponsible ” , and blamed them for neglecting their own children . He said that the manner in which children led their lives exposed them to killings , which he felt had no bearing on the State . He had received no reports of police involvement in the killing of any child . The children , according to him , were killed in encounters because “ they ( the children ) are out of their minds ” . He recounted an incident where a child had raped his mother and sister as an example of children who were “ mentally abnormal ” and cautioned the Special Rapporteur in making comparisons in the behaviour of children in the “ first and the third world ” . Children of the third world , according to his analysis , matured sooner and therefore deserved the same treatment as adults who broke the law . He also said that the police were not responsible for dealing with social problems , which were mainly the concern of IHNFA . However , in his view , IHNFA lacked the resources and skills to deal with the problem of street children effectively . On 14 August 2001 , the Special Rapporteur held a follow-up meeting with the Minister for Public Security , during which she also raised the cases referred to in section A above and other incidents related to her by witnesses . The Minister readily admitted that impunity was a deeply rooted problem perpetuating human rights violations , including extrajudicial killings . He attributed many of these irregularities to poor training of judges and political interference in the work of the judiciary . He pointed out that judges were often appointed on the basis of their politics and contacts rather than their professional or academic competence . He stressed that legal reforms could only achieve limited results as long as the same individuals remained on their posts . He noted that his Ministry had already started purging the police force of unsuitable staff , especially those responsible for abuses of authority or human rights violations . New recruits were being trained , but in the meantime the Honduran police remained weak . The Minister stressed that the lack of professional investigators was particularly critical . During the meeting the Minister also presented the Special Rapporteur with comprehensive dossiers containing information about cases she had raised in her correspondence with the Government . The material referred to the cases of the following minors : Victor Daniel Ruiz , Gerson Edgardo Calix Núñez , Ángel Gabriel Bonilla , Esteban Varela Pérez , Willmer Alberto Bonilla , Alexander Obando Reyes , Noe Alejandro Álvarez Rivas , Luis Alfredo Villanueva and Ermelindo Aguilar . According to this information , investigations had been launched into all of these alleged cases of extrajudicial executions by police officers perpetrated between March and October 1999 . In one of the cases the suspect had been detained , and in one an arrest warrant had been issued . C. Alleged extrajudicial killings and death threats against members of indigenous communities , environmental activists and human rights defenders During her mission , the Special Rapporteur received reports and heard testimonies about cases in which environmental and indigenous activists had been killed at the behest of powerful landowners and business people . In most of these cases , it was alleged that the perpetrators enjoyed virtual de facto immunity from prosecution because of their social status and political connections . Reports indicate that at least 25 indigenous leaders have been killed in the last 10 years in Honduras . NGOs and local activists allege that the authorities have taken little or no action to bring those responsible to justice . Most of these killings have been carried out in the context of land disputes and have often been attributed to individuals or groups with links to the local authorities , business people and the military . On 18 June 2001 , the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation to the Government regarding the case of Carlos Roberto Flores , an activist and leader of a community affected by the construction of a hydroelectric dam on Rio Babilonia . It was alleged that Mr. Flores was shot dead on 30 June 2001 by private security guards , in connection with a demonstration against the project in Gualaco , Department of Olancho . Reportedly , members of the community had received death threats after they had expressed their opposition to the construction , which , in their view , was threatening the environment and the livelihood of the local people . In her letter , the Special Rapporteur urged the Government to inform her of the steps taken to investigate the killing of Mr. Flores and to protect the rights to life and personal security of other members of the community concerned . It its reply of 14 June 2002 , the Government stated that on 24 May , as well as on 2 and 5 June 2001 , Mr. Flores , together with several other persons , had attacked vehicles , installations and employees of the hydroelectric company Energisa . Following these incidents an arrest warrant had been issued for Mr. Flores and seven of his associates . The letter further indicated that an arrest warrant had been issued for five persons believed to be responsible for Mr. Flores ' murder . However , none of the suspects , all believed to employees of a private security firm , had been apprehended . On 3 August 2001 , the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal following reports that Mr. Flores ' family and several other members of the community , including children , had been subjected to more death threats , presumably from persons connected with the above-mentioned private security guards . While in Tegucigalpa , the Special Rapporteur met with family members of Carlos Luna López , a local official in Catacamas , Department of Olancho . Mr. Luna , who was active in campaigns for social justice and environmental protection , was killed on 18 May 1998 , while investigating claims of illegal logging in the municipality . It is believed that influential business people in the timber industry , who had previously threatened Mr. Luna , were responsible for his murder . While the person who carried out the murder is now in detention , it is alleged that the persons who ordered the killing remain at large and have not been investigated or prosecuted for this crime . In a letter of 10 August 2001 , the Special Rapporteur requested the Government to inform her of the investigations undertaken in this case . During the Special Rapporteur 's follow-up meeting with the Minister for Public Security on 14 August , the Minister gave her documents describing the investigations . The material , which was dated 8 September 1999 , gave an overview of the police investigation into the case , without further explaining the outcome of any criminal proceedings initiated . The situation of Honduran human rights defenders has been difficult in the last few years , with several activists having received death threats . On 5 June 2001 , the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights defenders regarding the case of Pedro Marchetti , a priest and human rights defender . It was reported that a powerful local politician had hired gunmen to kill Fr . Marchetti who , over the years , had helped peasant farmers to defend their land against the claims of large landowners . He had also been campaigning for justice in the 1997 murder of environmental activist Carlos Escaleras . In its reply of 2 July 2001 , the Government of Honduras stated that the competent authorities had drawn up a security plan for Fr . Marchetti 's protection and that investigations into the threats had been initiated . The right to life of members of sexual minorities During her visit , the Special Rapporteur also had the opportunity to talk to representatives of sexual minorities and organizations working to protect and promote the human rights of these persons . Among the allegations brought to her attention were several reports of death threats and killings directed against members of sexual minorities . In 1999 , a young gay man was allegedly shot dead by private security guards close to a gas station in San Pedro Sula . When members of an NGO tried to report the case to the police , they were allegedly threatened and verbally abused at the police station . The Special Rapporteur was told that no investigation had been carried out into this killing . Similarly , in May 2001 a transsexual sex-worker was reportedly murdered behind the San Pedro Sula Cathedral . While it is reported that the police removed the body from the scene , it is alleged that no investigations have been initiated into the case . Non-governmental sources alleged that some 200 gay and transsexual sex-workers were killed in Honduras in the period 1991-2001 . Reportedly , few of these cases have ever been officially recorded , and fewer still investigated . E. Steps taken by the Government of Honduras As mentioned earlier in this report , on 11 September 2001 , the Permanent Mission of Honduras sent a letter to the Special Rapporteur transmitting the IHNFA report entitled “ Preliminary report on violent deaths among adolescents in Honduras ” . The document is a compilation of contributions from a range of Honduran public institutions covering various aspects of the issue , including the economic and social conditions in the country , and containing a brief description of the problem of juvenile violence and delinquency in Honduras . The document also contains a short commentary on a report by Casa Alianza on alleged extrajudicial killings of minors . A chapter of the report describes a range of initiatives taken by State institutions with regard to violence among and against juveniles . In this connection , the Special Rapporteur was informed that the Ministry for Public Security had set up the following prevention programmes : ( a ) Training in Resisting and Preventing Maras ( EREM ) - a training and awareness-raising programme for children in the fifth and sixth years of primary education ; ( b ) the “ Challenges ” programme , aimed at the adolescent population ; ( c ) the “ Wake up ” programme , aimed at parents and community leaders ; ( d ) the “ Basic facts about Maras ” ( COBAMA ) programme , aimed at primary , secondary and higher education teachers ; and ( e ) the internal police training programme . According to the report , more than 9,900 young people , 3,511 parents , 862 teachers and 154 police have been involved in these programmes so far . It was also explained that IHNFA was offering a number of services , including : ( a ) community family care ; ( b ) vocational workshops for adolescents “ in social risk situations ” ; ( c ) immediate temporary protection for child victims of serious abuse ; ( d ) promotion of adoption of children with no family ; ( e ) scholarships ; and ( f ) implementation of precautionary and correctional measures imposed by court decisions against adolescents who committed criminal offences . This includes programmes of non-custodial measures for juvenile offenders . In its report IHNFA also noted that in its report on the implementation of the observations and recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child , the Government of Honduras had noted , inter alia : ( a ) the post of National Human Rights Commissioner had been ratified by constitutional reform through Decree No. 191-94 of 15 December 1994 ; ( b ) the Domestic Violence Act had been adopted by parliament ; ( c ) compulsory military service had been abolished by constitutional reform in 1995 ; ( d ) the Code on Children and Adolescents had been adopted , faithfully reflecting the principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ; ( e ) new legislation consistent with the Convention was being adopted , particularly in regard to age-limits for employment and criminal responsibility ; ( f ) a new code on children and juvenile justice had been adopted ; ( g ) seven children 's courts were in operation in Honduras ( Tegucigalpa , San Pedro Sula , Santa Rosa de Coán , El Progreso , La Ceiba , Juticalpa and Choluteca ) ; ( h ) the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Children and the Disabled was created . It is noteworthy that in its report the Government noted that the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions is very clear and does not cover violence characteristic of a social problem such as increasingly violent youth gangs , a problem that the State of Honduras is beginning to study with a view to taking measures . At the same time , however , the Government stressed that adolescent deaths are a major concern for the State , which was making every effort to find the perpetrators and combat impunity . In the report IHNFA also recommended that criminal investigations should be undertaken into all cases of violent deaths among young people reported by national and international non-governmental organizations . Significantly , IHNFA recommended that the judicial system be strengthened , “ in particular the juvenile criminal justice system to ensure that the population is aware that it works properly and will in fact resolve cases , in order to prevent people , or particular groups of people , from taking justice into their own hands ” ( emphasis added ) . The report also recommends that the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions be kept informed of progress made in investigating and establishing responsibility in reported cases . The material collected and analysed for the present report makes it abundantly clear that children have been killed in Honduras by members of the security forces . In most of the cases the child was unarmed and did not provoke the police to use force , let alone lethal force . There have been very few investigations and trials in incidents of extrajudicial killings and convictions are exceptional . In addition to institutionalized impunity , there is a campaign to build a public opinion which supports the “ cleansing ” of the streets of Honduras of undesirable children . The action taken so far by the Government has not delivered a clear message to the police that they will be brought to justice for abuse of authority or for human rights violations . Neither have powerful groups suspected of having been involved in such crimes been apprehended or given a signal by the authorities that they cannot resort to murder under the pretext of trying to create a climate for economic revival . The Special Rapporteur wishes to remind the Government that it is ultimately the human rights record , stability and rule of law of the country that will inspire confidence among donors and investors , not high-handedness and violence by the powerful against the more vulnerable members of society . The Government of Honduras has taken a number of laudable steps towards honouring its commitments to the welfare of children . However , these initiatives have so far largely focused on needs-based charity , rather than on prioritizing the rights of children within an overall framework for the protection and promotion of human rights in Honduras . In this way , children are often not seen as subjects who have rights , but as objects who may be granted charity and privileges . Children , like adults , are entitled to receive information , in particular about their status and rights . Information about the extrajudicial killing of children should be made available and accessible . Information on all governmental and non-governmental initiatives and projects seeking to protect the rights of children should be made available in places frequented by children . The media should be encouraged to play a proactive role in this area . The Government of Honduras has set up juvenile courts to address the country 's mounting problem of juvenile delinquency , and measures have been put in place to protect the rights of children in custody . However , these steps have not served to protect the right to life of children , nor do they ensure that the perpetrators of extrajudicial killings are apprehended and punished . The juvenile courts also do not generate information about child victims . While crimes committed by children could easily be analysed on the basis of data collected by the juvenile courts , the Special Rapporteur was not given any reliable official records on crimes committed against children . The monitoring of every single trial of such cases places a heavy burden on the human and other resources of non-governmental organizations and other semi-autonomous institutions with a mandate to monitor child rights . In order to better understand the situation and have a solid basis for sound policy decisions in this area , the Government needs to systematically generate reliable aggregate data on crimes and human rights violations committed against children , especially extrajudicial killings . The Government of Honduras is urged to consider setting up an independent redress mechanism , such as an ombudsperson for children . Such institutions are in place in a number of countries , and Honduras should be encouraged to seek advice and support on this issue from other Governments and international agencies . The office of the ombudsperson should have quasi-judicial powers and be provided with an independent investigative machinery . Amongst other functions , three are particularly important : ( a ) The independent mechanisms need to be mandated to receive and act upon individual cases of extrajudicial cases which the competent authorities fail to register or prosecute ; ( b ) It should keep a complete record of extrajudicial and other killings of children and monitor the progress made in the investigation and prosecution of each case ; ( c ) It should be mandated to compile periodic reports reflecting the work it has undertaken and publicizing the findings and recommendations it has presented to the Government . All killings of children must be thoroughly investigated . The Government must meet its obligation to resolve the mystery of the children who have been killed by unknown perpetrators . The Government should set up a commission , with the participation of non-governmental organizations and the National Human Rights Commissioner , to study the situation with a view to formulating concrete recommendations and policy guidelines to ensure that these killings are thoroughly and independently investigated , and that those responsible are brought to justice without delay . A large number of the child victims have been killed by employees of private security companies . It is the responsibility of the Ministry for Public Security to put in place rules and procedures to monitor and supervise the operations of these companies . Particular emphasis should be placed on the use of firearms and other lethal force by private security guards . These companies should under no circumstances be regarded as a substitute for or be allowed to take over the functions of the law-enforcement authorities . Years of armed conflict in Central America have left the region awash with small arms and munitions . While efforts aimed at curtailing arms trafficking are important , the authorities must ensure that the officially sanctioned sale of arms and ammunition is strictly controlled , and that relevant laws and regulations are consistently enforced . The Government should urgently carry out a thorough review of the laws and practices pertaining to the licensing and sale of firearms and ammunition , with a view to ensuring that the number of officially licensed guns is significantly reduced and that persons wishing to purchase such items are thoroughly screened before they are given a licence . The Hondurans , children and adults alike , will not receive justice unless the legal and judicial systems are made independent , efficient and transparent . Recommendations on strengthening the judiciary have been made by various commissions appointed by the parliament and by the Bar Associations . General recommendations on this issue are also regularly submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers . The Government is urged to study these recommendations and seek technical assistance with a view to strengthening the country 's justice system . The relevant government authorities should arrange special orientation courses with a strong rights element for officials who come directly into contact with children . United Nations agencies are encouraged to extend technical support for this . The Honduran media have a heavy responsibility in denouncing violence and demanding an end to impunity for extrajudicial killings of children . The media and government officials , especially those in higher authority , must interact with , listen to and hear the voices of children before making decisions for children or suppositions about them . The media , in cooperation with the relevant authorities , could play a crucial role in sensitizing the public and bringing about a culture of respect for the rights of children and adolescents , in particular their right to life . The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the commitment of non-governmental organizations working in the area of child rights . The dedication and empathy of some individuals within those organizations gave hope and strength to children . Because of the complex , sensitive and often traumatic circumstances of the killings of children , such cases should be entrusted to staff with special training and be supervised by senior staff . The Church should also be supported and encouraged in its work with street children , so that it remains available to assist and support children and adolescents who are trying to leave the street gangs . Children form the majority of the population in Honduras . They are also the most vulnerable section of society . There is now a need to reprioritize resource allocations so that children are placed at the centre of all budget planning . Children have needs and rights beyond those of education and health . The Government should give its urgent and undivided attention to the protection and promotion of the civil and political , as well as economic , social and cultural rights of all children . Many of the victims of extrajudicial killings come from single-parent families usually headed by the mother . The disempowerment of women is closely linked to the marginalization of children . The Government has made some advances in promoting the rights of women , but these efforts have so far remained piecemeal and sporadic . The Government now needs to formulate and put in place a holistic policy on women 's rights , with particular emphasis on the empowerment of single mothers . E / CN.4 / 2003 / 3 / Add.2

Executive summary Gaborone Declaration on Indigenous Peoples and Minorities in Africa The participants at the seminar on multiculturalism in Africa meeting in Gaborone from 18 to 22 February 2002 call upon the Governments of Africa to recognize and respect the rights of indigenous peoples and minorities living within their States . The participants expressed the view that indigenous peoples and minorities in Africa have a spiritual , ancestral relationship to their traditional lands and resources , face exclusion from political and developmental processes in many countries , and are vulnerable to national policies that do not respect their cultural specificity .

It was stressed that indigenous peoples and minorities constitute a part of the cultural diversity and heritage of all African States . Furthermore , it was noted that , in the light of efforts by African States to promote peace and security for citizens , reduce poverty , and foster sustainable development and good governance and democracy , the knowledge systems , land and resource management skills , perceptions , visions and traditions of indigenous peoples and minorities are an indispensable source for the elaboration of alternative models of indigenous development for the continent .

Annex The proposal to hold seminars on minority and indigenous peoples ' issues in Africa had been made by both the Working Group on Minorities and the Working Group on Indigenous Populations and endorsed in resolutions 2000 / 16 , 1999 / 19 and 1999 / 20 of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights . The purpose of these activities is to raise awareness of the United Nations work on indigenous peoples and minority questions , stimulate a dialogue on the concepts to have a better understanding of new approaches that might apply in Africa , share experiences in successful group accommodation , and build NGO capacity . In the light of the recommendations of these two bodies , the Office organized a first workshop on Multiculturalism in Africa : peaceful and constructive group accommodation in situations involving minorities and indigenous peoples in Arusha , Tanzania in June 2000 , and a second workshop in Kidal , Mali in January 2001 . These workshops have provided a useful forum for exchanges regarding sustainable development in “ remote ” areas and traditional conflict resolution . The third workshop was held in Gaborone , Botswana , from 18 to 22 February 2002 . The Gaborone seminar is a follow-up to the two previous workshops held in Africa as well as the Durban World Conference Against Racism where consultations were held with indigenous and minorities as well as Government representatives to consider appropriate ways to reflect on the results of the Durban Conference . The seminar was organized by the Working Group on Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa ( WIMSA-Botswana ) , the Chairpersons of the United Nations Working Groups on Minorities and on Indigenous Populations in cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( OHCHR ) and UNDP-Gaborone . Indigenous and minority participants were from Botswana , Namibia , South Africa , Morocco , Ethiopia , Cameroon , Rwanda , Zimbabwe , Tanzania and Kenya . Mr. Rodolfo Stavenhagen , Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people , Mr. Yeung Sik Yuen , member of the Working Group on Minorities and Mr. Biong Deng , regional representative of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Southern Africa , also contributed to the seminar . Several international organizations and academic institutions such as Minority Rights Group International ( London ) , International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs ( Denmark ) , the University of Pretoria , the University of Botswana / Basarwa Research Project and also DITSHWANELO - The Botswana Centre for Human Rights actively contributed . Botswana Government officials also attended the seminar . They were : Hon. D.K. Kwelagobe , Minister for Presidential Affairs and Public Administration , Major General Moeng Pheto , Coordinator of the Remote Area Dweller Programme , Mr. Molale , Ministry of Local Government , Mrs. Modise , Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Mrs. Sibisibi , Ministry of Labour and Home Affairs and Mrs. Oliphant , Permanent Secretary , Political Affairs . The Chairpersons of the two United Nations working groups also invited the Permanent Missions in Geneva of countries in the African region and relevant United Nations departments , organizations and specialized agencies to send representatives to the workshop . The comprehensive list of the participants is contained at the end of the present report . The workshop was divided into three parts : ( a ) a two-day training session for participants representing indigenous peoples and minorities on United Nations human rights mechanisms and the African system for the protection of human and peoples ' rights ; ( b ) a two-day seminar on multiculturalism in Africa focusing on participation of indigenous peoples and minorities in development , traditional methods of conflict prevention and resolution , as well as a consideration of the concepts of “ minorities ” and “ indigenous ” peoples in the African context ; ( c ) a one-day round-table led by the UNDP Resident Representative with the participation of the country offices of United Nations organizations and specialized agencies . A summary of the training session is contained in part A of the present report . Part B covers the seminar discussion on multiculturalism in Africa and part C provides a brief summary of the round-table exchange on the United Nations system and indigenous peoples and minorities . The recommendations of the seminar are available at the end of the report . The seminar was opened by Hon. D.K. Kwelagobe , Minister for Presidential Affairs and Public Administration , who thanked the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights for the invitation to participate and for choosing Botswana as a venue for the seminar . He said that the focus on peaceful and constructive accommodation is both relevant and appropriate as it comes at a time when there are different views and competing propositions on the rights of minorities and indigenous peoples throughout the world . He noted that it was commonly known that nation States around the world have been formed out of a diversity of cultures and are constantly facing the challenges of constructing oneness in diversity . He added that there were no Botswana who are denied the right to practice their culture or the right to live where they choose . He stressed that the process of relocation of the Basarwa from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve ( CKGR ) that began in 1986 was a way to provide sustainable development , with the purpose of affording the Basarwa facilities and services . He stressed that no Basarwa have been forcefully removed from the CKGR . He concluded by wishing success for the seminar and encouraging the participants to make constructive recommendations which would be meaningful in Africa . Ms. Alice Mogwe , Director of DITSHWANELO - The Botswana Centre for Human Rights , welcomed the participants , saying that it was significant that this seminar was being held in Botswana . She explained that the country has a population of approximately 1.5 million of which about 4 per cent were the Basarwa or San people , the indigenous peoples of Botswana . She said that the indigenous peoples of southern Africa numbered approximately 100,000 . She maintained that the Government displays an ambivalent attitude toward the recognition of the concept of multiculturalism and that the current model of development was based on the provision of infrastructure as a major indicator of progress and success . She hoped that the seminar will help to explore alternative models of development . She was pleased that the seminar included representatives of indigenous and minority ethnic groups and looked forward to discussing these concepts . She indicated that , in Botswana , the survival strategy of minority groups has been to integrate while retaining their identity through the creation of cultural groups such as the Society for the Promotion of the Ikalanga Languages ( SPIL ) . The integrationist model is manifested in the recognition by the Constitution that there are minor tribes in Botswana . She noted that the Government had , to date , not yet officially recognized the existence of indigenous people because they argue “ we are all indigenous ” . Ms. Mogwe referred to the relocation of the Basarwa from the CKGR to the two settlements of Kaudwane and New Xade . The Government position , she said , was to move communities so that they could enjoy the benefits of development but she said she believed that participation in decision-making is an important indicator of development . In this respect she proposed that the Basarwa people be involved in sustainable wildlife management which ensured their participation in development . She asked what the difference was between minority groups and indigenous peoples . She said she believed that indigenous people are excluded from decision-making processes whereas some minority , ethnic groups were fully participating . She looked forward to the seminar discussing this issue and rights-based development . She expressed her thanks to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights for providing this opportunity . Mr. Mathambo Ngakaeaja spoke on behalf of the Working Group on Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa ( WIMSA ) . He said that his organization was pleased to be sponsoring the workshop and he welcomed the participants to Botswana . He made a brief commentary and expressed his concern about the situation of the Basarwa people of Botswana and said that he hoped there would be an opportunity to discuss the issues they raised during the seminar . Speaking on behalf of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights ( OHCHR ) , Mr. Julian Burger expressed his thanks to the Government of Botswana for agreeing to host the seminar . He expressed his gratitude to DITSHWANELO - The Botswana Centre for Human Rights and the Working Group on Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa for their cooperation in the preparations of the seminar . He also thanked the ILO for assisting with the participation of two indigenous representatives and the UNDP Botswana for their excellent support . Mr. Burger explained that the workshop would be divided into three parts consisting of a training module , seminar and inter-agency consultation . He said that the idea of the workshop was to provide everyone with a good understanding of international and regional human rights standards before embarking on the seminar . He hoped the seminar would be a useful space for minority and indigenous peoples as well as with governmental officials and academics to exchange experiences and formulate proposals . He said that the reason for concluding with a one-day inter-agency round-table was to give the participants an opportunity to consider how their recommendations might be put into practice by the United Nations system . A two-day training session was facilitated by Mr. Julian Burger of the OHCHR . During the training session , participants were provided with the United Nations Guide for Minorities as well as the United Nations Guide for Indigenous Peoples , both of them describing the international and regional human rights mechanisms pertaining to minority and indigenous peoples issues . There was an interactive and in-depth discussion about International human rights law , with the contribution of Mr. Sik Yuen , member of the Working Group on Minorities , Mr. Biong Deng , Head , OHCHR Southern Africa Sub-Regional Office in Pretoria , and Mr. Rodolfo Stavenhagen , Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of Indigenous People . Mr. Julian Burger explained how non-governmental organizations can use the United Nations human rights mechanisms including the treaty bodies , the complaints procedures , and the special rapporteur system . He also provided information about the Charter-based bodies such as the Commission on Human Rights . He gave background information about how the minority and indigenous peoples issues were dealt with by the United Nations and referred to the Working Group on Minorities , the Working Group on Indigenous Populations , the Working Group on the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the new Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues that will hold its first session in New York in May 2002 . He also provided information on how indigenous and minority representatives could use these mechanisms to raise their issues . Ms. Samia Slimane gave a presentation on the African human rights system . She introduced the new Constitutive Act of the African Union adopted in June 2000 in Lomé , Togo that replaces the 1963 Charter of the Organization of African Unity . She pointed out that article 3 of the Act lays down that one of the objectives of the African Union is to promote and protect human and peoples ' rights in accordance with the African Charter on Human and Peoples ' Rights ( African Charter ) and other relevant human rights instruments . Ms. Slimane explained that the African Charter recognize collective rights referred to as “ peoples ' rights ” . She also informed the participants about the work of the African Commission on Human and Peoples ' Rights ( African Commission ) which is the monitoring body for the implementation of the African Charter . She said that the African Commission adopted the Resolution on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples / Communities in Africa in November 2000 that establishes a Working Group of experts on the rights of indigenous peoples or communities in Africa . Ms. Slimane concluding by asking the participants to participate more in the work of the African Commission since there is a way for a better protection for indigenous peoples and minorities in Africa . Mr. Biong Deng gave a presentation on the New Partnership for Africa 's Development ( NEPAD ) . He explained the background to the initiative which was based on the merger of two Africa-wide plans of action - the Millennium Partnership for the African Recovery Programme ( MAP ) and the Omega Plan . The NEPAD covered peace and security since it was understood that there can be no development in a war situation . It also deals with key concepts such as good governance , democracy and human rights . He pointed out that the NEPAD addresses the question of corruption and the need to have free and fair election . Mr. Nigel Crawhall , speaking on behalf of UNESCO , informed the participants that UNESCO has special programmes to support multilingual education and education for indigenous children . He also mentioned that UNESCO was carrying out a significant cross-sector project about traditional knowledge . Further , he introduced the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity adopted in November 2001 which deals with key concepts such as diversity and pluralism . He referred to article 4 of the Declaration , which speaks about human rights and diversity . He concluded by saying that UNESCO 's role was to promote respect for everyone 's culture as everyone has the right to be who they are , to speak their language and participate in a national system . Mr. Ole Kaunga , representative of the ILO in Tanzania , delivered a comprehensive presentation on how the organization has been involved in the situation of indigenous and tribal peoples . He mentioned the active role the ILO played regarding forced labour of so-called “ native populations ” in colonies . He referred to the Convention 107 as the first attempt to codify the right of indigenous and tribal population in international law , and covered a range of issues such as land rights , working conditions , health and education . He said that the Convention 107 of 1957 adopted an integrationist approach based on the assumption that indigenous and tribal populations were destined to disappear into the dominant society . This assumption began to be challenged and led to the adoption in 1989 of the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention ( 169 ) by the International Labour Conference . Mr. Ole Kaunga pointed out that the 169 Convention refers to “ peoples ” . It is meant to encourage the establishment of a new relationship between the States and indigenous and tribal peoples , based on the recognition and respect of cultural and ethnic diversity . He added that another fundamental change was the premise that these peoples and their traditional organizations should be closely involved in the planning and implementation of development projects that affect them . Mr. Ole Kaunga concluded by saying that so far no African countries ratified Convention 169 . Ms. Jackie Sims from WHO presented an outline of WHO 's Global Strategy on Indigenous Health . She explained that the Strategy contains several goals dedicated to raising awareness of the relevance of ethnicity to health . She mentioned the Strategy 's goal to improve health and demographic information systems so that more accurate data is available regarding health trends among indigenous peoples . Additionally , she spoke about the Strategy 's aim to increase health awareness of indigenous peoples so that they are better equipped to deal with any health risks associated with their lifestyle . The Strategy also discusses the need to improve the capacity of national and local health systems to respond to indigenous health concerns . Ms. Sims highlighted that WHO defines its own role as supporting national programmes that raise the profile of ethnicity in relation to health . She concluded by asking the participants to provide her with recommendations on how they believed WHO could further work to improve indigenous health , and assured the participants that WHO would be grateful for their input . At the opening of the seminar , participants were invited to nominate a Chairperson-Rapporteur . The participants invited Ms. Alice Mogwe , representing DITSHWANELO - The Botswana Centre for Human Rights , to act as Chairperson-Rapporteur . Ms. Mogwe thanked the participants . The agenda and programme of work were then adopted . The programme consisted of the following themes : “ Discussion on the concepts of indigenous peoples , minority communities , ethnic groups and tribes , as applied in the African context ” , “ Discussion on the participation of indigenous peoples and minorities in local and national development plans ” , and “ Constructive group accommodation in situations involving minorities and indigenous peoples , including traditional conflict resolution ” . Ms. Slimane then drew attention to the six background papers commissioned by the Office of the High Commissioner . She said that efforts had been made to invite African experts from different countries having grassroots experience to prepare the papers . The background papers available at the meeting were : “ Acknowledging indigenous capacities of social security control in East Africa ” by Sultan Somjee ; “ Marginalization of pastoral communities from decision-making in Ethiopia with focus on multiculturalism and ethnic heterogeneity ” by Melakou Tegegn ; “ Meaning of the concepts of Minority and Indigenous Peoples and their relationship in the African context : Examples from Botswana ” by Andy Chebanne ; “ The role of women demanding linguistic and cultural rights : the case of the Wayeyi of Botswana ” by Lydia Nyati-Ramahobo ; “ The San and the issue of participation of minorities in national development : An example from Botswana ” by Isaac Mazonde ; “ Indigenous women of Africa and access to resources : the Samburu women of Kenya ” by Lucy Mulenkei . Discussion on the concepts of indigenous peoples and minorities in the African context Dr. Chebanne opened the seminar session by presenting his paper on the “ meaning of the concept of minorities and indigenous peoples and their relationship in the African context : Examples from Botswana ” . He explained that normally indigenous peoples were distinguished from other groups by their prior settlement in the territory in which they lived , combined with the maintenance of a separate culture closely linked to land and natural resources . He said that the concept minority was related to demographic considerations but also included social and economic powerlessness , subordination , lack of territoriality and vulnerability in matters of linguistic and cultural life . He noted that the term minority is amenable to socio-political definition in Botswana but the same could not be said about the term indigenous . He explained the reason was historical because Bantu speakers settled in Southern Africa from about year 1000 and Khoi and San communities were reported to have been in the region for more than 10,000 years . Using a strict interpretation , he said , the Khoi and San would consider the Bantu to be settlers . The colonial discourse , he noted , consider all black Africans , Khoi and San peoples included , as indigenous . With independence , African countries had difficulty accepting concepts such as minorities or indigenous due to some remaining colonial stigma and fears that some communities might claim ancestral rights to territories . The question , he said , is not who is indigenous or minority but who did not have ethnic rights ( linguistic , cultural ) recognized by the State . In Botswana for example , he said , what distinguished the plight of Bakalanga , Bayeye and Basubiya people who essentially share the same development culture with the Setswana-speaking communities is access to ones own language in the administrative structure of the State . Khoi and San groups however he said have problems in benefiting from economic access to development . He said that groups such as the Bakalanga were linguistic minorities but not economic minorities . Their economic power allowed them to participate . The Khoi and San are poor and this diminished their status . He called for a cultural policy in Botswana and drew attention to the impact of globalization on cultural communities . The Chair thanked Dr. Chebanne for his presentation . She said that the concepts of indigenous peoples and minorities caused discomfort in many African States . She considered that the difficulties attached to the terms stemmed from the colonial history of Africa in which the indigenous population was defined by the foreign colonial power . However , in her view , the Kwe and San were indigenous minorities in Botswana in terms of their unique culture , language and social organization . She also recognized that there were minorities in the country that had access to economic resources and others that did not and that perhaps this constituted a means of better understanding the notions of indigenous and minority . Botswana like other African States , she said , had a Constitution that tried to eliminate ethnicity rather than recognize diversity . Mr. Stavenhagen said that he considered that the issues under discussion revolved around questions of empowerment and unequal relations . The difficulty was how to improve the negotiating power of the powerless . Using a concept such as indigenous was one way of recognizing that certain groups were marginalized and had specific needs . Mr. Balkassm noted that the majority of African States did not recognize cultural diversity and that policies predominantly focused on assimilation . He referred to his own region and the Amazigh-speaking peoples who lived in North Africa . He said that he preferred the term indigenous peoples rather than minorities . He did not consider his people a minority but as a majority dominated by an Arab minority pursuing a policy of Arabization . He said he was not in favour of definitions since they led to the exclusion of some groups . He also referred to the African Charter and ILO 169 , both of which use the concept of peoples . He concluded by noting that the post-colonial African States in his region had not recognized customary laws and land rights . Mr. Solomon Isaac admitted that the term indigenous was difficult in Africa . He agreed that all peoples were indigenous to Africa . However , he said that the term indigenous peoples referred to groups indigenous to a particular territorial area . He added that African peoples were indigenous to Africa but not indigenous to every part of the continent . He regretted that some African Constitutions did not recognize the territories of indigenous peoples and that consequently specific ethnic groups oppressed others . Ms. Mulenkei said that there was a need for care when using the terms minorities and indigenous peoples . She explained that the United Nations had two working groups , one for minorities and one for indigenous peoples and that they were open forums that function on self-identification . She observed that the Government of Botswana was not proud of the Basarwa . She said she felt that the relocation would lead to loss of language and identity and this would be sad for the country . In her own country , Kenya , she said she believed that the Government was proud of the Maasai and other pastoralist peoples . She asked why the Government did not protect the Basarwa if they were the first peoples of the country . She agreed that it was desirable to strengthen the NGOs in the country . Ms. Victoria Geingos , representative of the San people of Namibia stated that she considered her peoples the first peoples of their region and that relocation had a serious impact on their traditions and culture . Moving members of her people to towns had resulted in loss of language and identity and caused great suffering . Professor Sidsel Saugestad expressed the view that using the term indigenous peoples might not be the most expedient given the current positions of governments . She realized that the Basarwa had special needs and that welfare measures were needed as well as the recognition of rights . Overview of multiculturalism in southern Africa and experiences elsewhere in Africa Dr. Lydia Nyathi-Ramahobo presented her paper on “ The role of women in demanding linguistic and cultural rights : the case of the Wayeyi of Botswana ” . She explained that the Wayeyi are one of the so-called minority tribes in Botswana which are not recognized in the Constitution and the chieftainship Act . She said that these laws recognize only Tswana-speaking tribes and that sections 77-79 of the Constitution guarantee ex officio membership to the House of Chiefs to only those eight Setswana-speaking tribes . The rest of the tribes , she said , were to assimilate under the chiefs of the eight tribes who ruled during the colonial era . She underlined that the Tribal Territories Act also defines tribal territory with respect to these tribes , meaning that only those tribes can own land and it is distributed under their jurisdiction . She gave the example of the dispossession of the Wayeyi and Basarwa from their land . This land was declared Tawana land by the present Government and was distributed under the jurisdiction of a Tawana land-board . As regards language in education policy , she mentioned that only Setswana and English were officially recognized to the exclusion of the 26 other languages . She recalled that the Wayeyi were and still are the majority although their language had become a minority language . She explained that at independence , the Government had declared that no language other than Setswana could be used for teaching or any other public purpose . She gave the example of Ikalanga as one of the languages that could no longer be taught in schools following independence . She said that all this signalled dark days for Wayeyi language , Shiyeyi , and its culture and led to the desire of the Wayeyi to have their own chief recognized and admitted into the House of Chiefs . She stressed that although in the past chieftainship and politics have been predominately male arenas of action , women have been in the leadership of the Wayeyi campaign for autonomy . Questions have been raised , she said , about having a woman to serve as the first chief . To conclude , she acknowledged that the motion passed by the Parliament in 1995 to review sections of the Constitution which discriminated against non-Setswana-speaking groups from representation in the House of Chiefs gave hope for a move in the right direction to achieve true democracy in which all tribes are treated as equal . However , she said that despite progressive policies , government had still not removed the negative provisions from the Constitution . A number of speakers referred to the post-colonial period during which the new African States had promoted national identity instead of multiculturalism . One participant said that the cultural policy of his Government was to create a monolithic entity without colour . Another noted that separate administrations had often existed on tribal reserves during the colonial period but that these had disappeared with independence when unitary States were the model . These overarching systems , it was stated , did not provide conditions for different cultures to thrive . During the seminar , the relocation of the Basarwa people from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve was mentioned . It was noted that relocation of peoples was a worldwide phenomenon usually impacting the politically weakest groups . Dr. Chebanne said that he considered both the Constitution of Botswana and the Government 's policy of relocation as assimilationist . He believed that the removal of Basarwa could lead to loss of language and identity and added that from a historic point of view the creation of the Game Reserve came well after the settlement in that region by these peoples . A San representative spoke about the situation of women and children in her community . She said the rights of women came last of all . She also said children from her community were employed to look after the cattle of the Tswana while the Tswana children went to school . She said it was painful to be a victim and to be weak . She stated that the Government did not listen to her people and that the only way of getting their voice heard was to establish strong organizations . Mr. Sultan Somjee argued that some African Constitutions represented the interests of particular groups and made a reference to Apartheid South Africa . He noted that many African Constitutions were the product of negotiations with the colonial powers of the time . His own Constitution , for example , was often referred to as the Lancaster House Constitution , after the place in London where the document was drafted . He believed that it would be desirable to review these Constitutions and listen to the voices of living traditions and recommended that the Western-educated elites might benefit from spending time with peoples such as the San and Basarwa . Mr. Melakou Tegegn said that there was not much debate in Africa about collective rights or African traditions of government . The new African States had continued with the prevailing systems and discourse , without the democratic content , inherited from their colonial masters . This has meant , he argued , that African Governments were often in conflict with traditional systems . Traditional knowledge and social and economic organization were seen as fitting in with the Western development model that prevailed in Africa . Hence , he said , in Ethiopia where he came from , peoples who practised pastoralism were seen as barbaric . Several Basarwa participants said that they believed it was necessary to struggle for their own culture . They regretted that the Government criticized their organizations . One member of the group said that his people were not tribalistic nor were they interested in politics . He noted that , despite the rich culture of his people , no mention was made of Basarwa people in the history books given to schoolchildren in the country . The representatives of the Government of Botswana welcomed the discussions but recalled that the seminar was on the broader concept of multiculturalism in Africa . It was not , they said , a seminar on Botswana . Ms. Oliphant said that the Constitution of the country did not privilege particular ethnic groups at the expense of others . She said that the tendency to sensationalize needed to be avoided . Mr. Balkassm defined culture as all manifestations of life , production and values . He said it was necessary to promote culture on the basis of equality and non-discrimination . He noted that occasionally customary laws were not favourable to women but he gave an example from the Atlas region of Morocco where Amazigh women receive half of the property in the event of a divorce . He said that Moroccan women were now fighting for the same rights , using the example from indigenous customary law . Mr. Fritz Pieter said that there was no such thing as an old and new culture . Culture is something inherited from the ancestors and used by the present generation . He said that culture was a precious gift that needed to be used , and not put in a cupboard to gather dust . Mr. Sik Yuen said there is no society in the world where there is monoculturalism . He argued for more tolerance and the recognition that different cultures were a definite plus in any society . He felt tolerance and respect were essential elements in building a multicultural society . He added that multiculturalism can even be seen as a minimum since nowadays we are even speaking about interculturalism and openness . Mr. Stavenhagen , however , added that in terms of cultural policies we should attempt to go beyond the idea of tolerance towards the idea of pluralism and respect as those concepts are more assertive and positive . Mr. Nigel Crawhall asked about the role of culture in development . He said that if communities are displaced from their traditional lands , and moved to new settlements , they may have new schools and water supply , but the impact of leaving the land they know , the food that they used to eat , and the neighbours they used to have , is that their culture is changed . He recalled that sometimes displacement can cause entire languages to die out leading to a loss of identity . They lose their memory of who they are although they do have a heritage and a history . He gave the example of South Africa where the apartheid system suppressed the heritage of coloured people . Mr. Jatti Bredekamp and Professor Nic Olivier provided information about the Khoi-San in South Africa . Mr. Bredekamp explained that the 1996 Constitution of South Africa did not recognize Khoi-San languages as official languages . He explained that although section 185 of the Constitution made provision for the establishment of a Commission for the protection and promotion of linguistic , cultural and religious communities in South Africa , this Commission has not yet been established . He said that when the Government talks about the Khoi-San status Quo Research process , it refers to five groups in South Africa , the San , Griquas , Koranas , Namas and Western Cape Khoe Khoi peoples . He said that this process had started in 1997 with the National Griqua Forum after the Griqua petitioned Nelson Mandela . There was a willingness of the Griqua to include other communities . The 1998 National Khoisan Forum was the result of this process that led to five reports for each of the five groups plus one of the South African Human Rights Commission . These reports were drawn together in the Integrated Khoisan Research Report that he and Professor Nic Olivier had compiled . The research report had been submitted to the Government on 4 October 2000 . He concluded by saying that the South African Government was supposed to release the report in 2002 . Development in a multicultural environment Ms. Corinne Lennox from International Minority Rights Group gave an overview of the issues relating to minority and indigenous rights in the development process . She examined such topics as access to land rights , rights over natural resources , impact of industries on communities and exclusion from basic social services . She referred to the recommendations made at an international meeting convened in July 2001 in the United Kingdom by Minority Rights Group International with the support of the OHCHR and the Working Group on Minorities on the subject of mainstreaming minority and indigenous rights in development . She called for redressing discrimination , ensuring participation and strengthening capacity as the way forward . Dr. Mazonde addressed the question of participation in development with reference to the San people . He said that the problem of the San was that they were marginalized . He believed that understanding perceptions was vital , namely how San perceive the non-San and vice versa . He noted that the San perceive that they are being discriminated against and continually dispossessed by the dominant non-San Batswana , including the State . He said that perceptions are one of the most important aspects of social or person-centred development , particularly with respect to indigenous peoples . He noted that the settlement policies being carried out by the Government did not benefit the Basarwa people even if this was not the intention . He said that although the San almost always constitute the largest proportion of the remote area dwellers ( RADs ) , they are hierarchically the lowest ethnic group in terms of resources , power and influence . He explained that RADs were made up of different peoples with varying ethnicities such as the Bakgalagadi and the dominant “ Batswana ” referred to as the “ blacks ” by the San . Therefore , development packages that are community-based did not prevent San people from being excluded . He recognized that Botswana has come to acknowledge the wisdom of cultural diversity , but the weaknesses of Basarwa , he said , should be acknowledged in Government policies . He called for action to reduce the negative stigma of Basarwa . He said that improving the economic status of Basarwa would raise their social image and make them visible . He noted that the lack of tangible action by the Government had meant that Basarwa looked for assistance from people outside Botswana . He gave the example of the San NGO “ First People of the Kalahari ” that had raised the Basarwa issue at the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations . In terms of education , Dr. Mazonde stressed that some problems would be easily solved if there were San teachers familiar with San culture . Mr. Ole Kaunga , representative of the ILO , referred to Dr Mazonde 's view regarding education . He accepted that education was important for indigenous peoples if they were to achieve development . However , he noted that education was not the only solution . He said a Maasai with a PhD can still be stigmatized and added that sometimes education only served to eliminate identity . He argued that the real need was to get governments to recognize that indigenous peoples ' economic systems also contribute to development . Mr. Pheto , on behalf of the Government of Botswana , explained that the Remote Area Dwellers programme was not only designed for Basarwa people but focused on all marginalized groups , whatever their origin . Ms. Oliphant explained that she was not at the seminar to defend the Government but to learn . She said that education was the responsibility of the Government and that she was concerned about education reaching Basarwa that live far from urban centres . Another speaker said that there was a need to concentrate on improvements in services rather than argue about indigenousness . Mr. Sik Yuen argued in favour of involving minorities in the State-building process . He referred to his own country , Mauritius , where the steps towards independence had been taken cautiously and with the full participation of the different minority groups . He explained that in the Constitution some parliamentary seats were reserved for ethnic groups . Ms. Mulenkei noted that indigenous peoples were often excluded from planning and policy-making as well as the implementation of community development . In Kenya this had meant that there were sometimes conflicts between the Maasai pastoralists and the departments responsible for wildlife management . The aim should be to involve indigenous peoples in joint management schemes . She also believed that the education system in indigenous communities was often unsuccessful because there was no involvement of indigenous peoples in the development of the curriculum or as teachers . Several San representatives said they believed it was important that children from their community got education in their own language . They did not agree with the policy of taking children from their families to educate them in hostels far away . Mr. Hassan Id Balkassm said that there was a link between development and the recognition of indigenous peoples in a country . He believed that development projects often were forces of destruction . Since in Africa there were few democratic governments , he said , this meant that there was little community participation in the development process . Mr. Melakou Tegegn spoke extensively about development and minorities and indigenous peoples . He argued that political exclusion of significant groups had led to underdevelopment . He characterized African Governments as having a view of development based on Westernization , industrialization and marketization . Indigenous peoples such as the pastoralist communities , he said , play no role in the development process . The pastoralist way of life had never been recognized as viable and instead all investment went towards producing more crops to produce a surplus and finance industrialization . He regretted that livestock were not seen as part of the national wealth of the country . He said that Africans needed to re-invigorate their traditional systems of government and redefine democracy and development . He also underlined the importance of women in development . Mr. Stavenhagen said that he saw many similarities between the situation in Africa and Latin America in particular with respect to involving civil society in development . He said that in his region civil society had been unable to flourish because of the strong authoritarian regimes . Democratization , he said , had brought elections but no real changes in the society . He said the dilemma was that the involvement of civil society in development processes was vital but even civil society organizations could become bureaucratized and non-democratic . He said that the efforts to build up more democratic States was closely related to multiculturalism . He said there was an increased dialogue concerning identity , something that did not exist 20 years earlier . He asked whether this was a transition and whether it was a way of redefining the State and taking it away from its unitary function . He noted that the United Nations was also looking at how to give expression to civil society in its work . Mr. Balkassm said that he recognized the growing importance of civil society but stated that there was sometimes a tension between these actors and indigenous peoples . He gave the example of Morocco where it was very hard to put the question of cultural rights on the agenda of human rights organizations . He said that such organizations often ignored cultural rights and collective issues such as rights over land . Mr. Melakou Tegegn welcomed the debate stimulated by the seminar . He said that it was important not to characterize governments as monsters . Policies derive from perceptions , he said , and perceptions can change . Ms. Lucy Mulenkei gave her presentation on the role of indigenous women in development . She said that her paper focused on a specific community , namely Samburu pastoralist women . Samburu people were cousins to her people : the Maasai . They speak almost the same language and share a similar culture and traditional way of life . The Samburu people live in the Northern part of Kenya 's Rift valley province , an area characterized by a semi-arid and arid climate and frequently hit by droughts . Their economy is mainly based on livestock . She highlighted the question of land , as in most countries where indigenous peoples lived , land was central when speaking about access to resources . She recalled that pastoralist communities had often been pushed to dry land to make room for farming . She explained that one of the major tasks of the Samburu indigenous women was to make sure that resources such as water are available . She noted that , after 40 years of independence , Samburu women still have to trek a very long way to get water . She gave the example of the Kiltemary Samburu community from Waso who collect the water they need from the Ewaso Nyiro River which is situated 20 km away and where many chemicals that are used by the farms are discharged . This environmental deterioration is a disproportionate burden for women , she added . Without clean and safe water , she noted , health issues increase dramatically endangering women 's lives , especially young mothers and their babies . She said that unfortunately , the Government does not care about the pastoralists and they continue to be marginalized . For a long time , the Government in Kenya did not consult indigenous communities when planning projects affecting them , she said . The Government also ignores the climate changes that affect semi-arid areas so dramatically . As regards education , she regretted the high illiteracy rate . She agreed with previous speakers that the gender aspect was crucial . In Kenya indigenous women were not treated equally to men in property law . She explained that although the statutory law of succession allows daughters to inherit property , its enforcement is still very much dictated by customary law and practices . Pastoralist communities still invest husbands with property rights . She stressed that there is a need to empower women so that they fully participate in the economy on an equal basis with men . She felt that promoting the education of girls was the way to achieve this goal . Mr. Ole Kaunga , representative of the ILO noted that indigenous lands were often the first that were confiscated when new developments were being undertaken . He added that unfortunately governments in the region continued to believe that indigenous peoples were responsible for environmental destruction , a position he rejected . In Kenya , he said , 95 per cent of military bases were on pastoralist lands . He also referred to the expansion of multinational activities in the Maasai region resulting in displacement of his people from their lands . Structural adjustment programmes had also added a further burden since governmental extension staff for development and technical assistance had been reduced . Ms. Maureen Tong referred to the argument often heard in South Africa during the apartheid period when it was argued that women 's rights should wait until the liberation struggle was completed . She did not agree with this position and said that the gender issue was an integral part of the discussions on development and indigenous peoples and minorities . Ms. Mulenkei noted that it was a very recent phenomenon that women 's concerns were discussed . She believed that efforts were needed to bridge the gap between men and women . Ms. Mbah spoke about her experiences in Cameroon where women were the breadwinners , collected firewood and water , prepared the food , looked after the children , and paid the taxes . She said that despite the important contribution of women , in many areas women could not inherit property . Ms Tong recalled Nelson Mandela who said that until women are free , the nation will never be free . Mr. Salomon Isaac made three recommendations to address development issues in multicultural societies . Firstly , there should be , he said , an equal distribution of natural resources and land for sustainable development . Second , decentralization of administration and civil service should be ensured . Lastly , he called for equal opportunities for education , without discrimination on ethnical or political bases . Participation in decision-making processes Mr. Melakou Tegegn presented his paper on “ Marginalization of pastoral communities from decision-making in Ethiopia ” . He stressed that development requires a legal right of participation . However , he said that even though there may be a legal regime that permits participation , the component of capacity was crucial to fully participate in development . He identified some of the issues . The first problem , he said , was the political marginalization of communities and society as a whole in decision-making processes . He said that as a result there was no space for participation in many countries in Africa . He said that African Governments had stepped into the shoes of the previous colonial States and tried to imitate and continue with the machinery they inherited from colonialism . This had a strong impact on development and governance . He argued that the exclusion of society from decision-making was one of the principal factors causing underdevelopment and poverty in Africa . He questioned the relationship that existed between government and society as a whole . He said that there is a polarization because society plays no role in politics . In most African countries there was not even consultation or discussion at all . Governments operate in the abstract . A second problem is that most governments have completely failed in the area of social development . They have not solved two fundamental problems , namely poverty and conflict . And at this point in time , these two problems are interrelated , and African governments are completely incapable of breaking this vicious cycle . From the development perspective , this cycle can only be broken by the active participation of society in the development and decision-making processes . He believed that this is where the question of indigenous populations comes in . He argued that the perception that African Governments have of indigenous populations is completely wrong . They think that development is always linked to industrialization . This perception of African Governments leaves no room for the participation of indigenous populations in the development process . In Ethiopia for instance , the Government has never recognized pastoralism as a way of life and a valuable system , whereas the peasant way of life is recognized and economic policy supports their contribution . In his view , African Governments should recognize indigenous economies and ensure that development is participatory and inclusive . Mr. Hassan Id Balkassm referred to the situation in Algeria where the Algerian Government does not have any real dialogue with the Amazigh representatives of the region of Kabylie . He said that there is a need for democratic constitutions that recognize the right of participation of all cultural movements and organizations . He said he was convinced that this is the only way to ensure Governments pursue consultative processes of decision-making . The role of traditional knowledge in conflict prevention Mr. Sultan Somjee presented his paper entitled “ Acknowledging indigenous capacities of social security control in East Africa ” . He identified several key points : the value system , the structural capacity within indigenous societies , symbols , and memory . The value system is what makes you fight or manage conflicts . Concerning conflicts between or with indigenous groups , he stressed that many of these clashes are provoked by non-indigenous peoples . Such conflicts are imported , often from the capital city , because of political interests . He maintained that values do not come from the State , but from the peoples themselves . He mentioned that there is a history of making war and peace in the northern hemisphere , and cited the Crusades , a war that was started based upon one group 's value system and which was considered a holy war . Yet , from an indigenous perspective in Eastern Africa , it was often questioned how a war could be “ holy ” . He also spoke about wisdom and memory of the elders which are stimulated and reinforced by symbols . Symbols are important , he said , as indigenous peoples are non-literate people , but they have tremendous capacity in visual and oral analysis , manufacturing , and communicating knowledge , which literate people have lost . He recognized that some of the indigenous peoples in Kenya are known as warriors but that others are peacemakers , stressing that the difference is their value system . It is the clan structures that have maintained the humanity of Africa ; this is because the values come not from the State , but from the peoples . Symbols , such as the peace tree and the peace staff ( which is made from the peace tree ) are used to manage conflict . He said that peace trees should be given visibility . For the Pokot , mothers wear a waist belt called leketyo because the womb represents life and life is sacred ; a mother is able to stop a conflict among fighting groups by removing the leketyo and throwing it between the groups . He stressed that this is a living tradition . He observed that there are two discourses in Africa : the discourse of the politicians and the discourse of the people . Yet many often only concentrate on that of the politicians . He maintained that it is the discourse of the people that holds identity and that can give more prominence to the people and their culture . Therefore memory must be kept alive . To do that in Eastern Africa , ethnographic and cultural peace museums have been used to show and educated people about peace . He stressed the importance of these Peace Museums which reflect the humanistic traditions , as compared with other types of museums which show war . Peace museums are managed by a group of elders and are used to facilitate discussions and the sharing of traditions amongst indigenous communities . Several participants spoke about conflict and traditional methods of peace-building . Mr. Ole Kaunga noted that conflict among pastoralists was a major issue . He said that depending on the nature of the conflict , traditional elders managed sometimes to take the responsibility of resolving them by leading successful negotiations for peace . Lucy Mulenkei observed that most of the conflicts amongst communities are caused by diminishing resources , leading to rivalries for water and grasslands . She noted that discussions involving elders working together are often more successful than those involving government officials . Mr. Angus Martens said that in many African countries there was a conflict between the approaches adopted by Governments and indigenous approaches as regards many aspects of indigenous cultures such as conflict resolution methods . Mr. Benon Mugarura thanked Mr. Sultan Somjee for his interesting presentation . He said there was a need to exchange experiences about traditional forms of conflict resolution and wondered how these peace-trees systems could be used in his country , Rwanda . He called for Peace Museums in Rwanda to educate and encourage the traditional means of healing the souls of his people . He said that the Rwandese Government had come to realize that the traditional justice system ( the Gacaca ) could help to reconcile people following the genocide . He explained that the Gacaca has been therefore introduced and will start in May 2002 to deal with genocide and conflicts within communities in Rwanda . Ms. Mbah stated that peace trees are commonly used amongst communities in Cameroon as a way to prevent tensions or conflicts . At its concluding meeting on 22 February 2002 , participants adopted several recommendations that are contained in the Gaborone Declaration on Indigenous Peoples and Minorities . This Declaration is available in Annex I. On the last day of the Workshop , time was set aside for an exchange of information with United Nations organizations and specialized agencies working in Botswana . The meeting was facilitated by Mr. Macharia Kamau , Resident Representative of UNDP . He explained that “ indigenous peoples ” was not a term that was used in the day-to-day work of the United Nations in Botswana . He said that projects were developed to address social and economic issues and that on that basis there was recognition of marginalized or vulnerable groups but not of indigenous peoples . He noted that the Government used an economic and service oriented approach . Mr. Kamau referred to the policy note of the UNDP on indigenous peoples . He also said that UNDP had sponsored a Hurist Workshop to discuss a human rights approach to development . In this framework , the Resident Representative said he believed there was a possibility of initiating development activities that took into account lifestyle . He saw opportunities in the programmes being elaborated to promote good governance and public sector reforms where there were often in-built biases towards ethnic groups . He also said that anti-poverty strategies might provide a space for programmes that focused on vulnerable groups . The representative of WHO explained that his organization worked closely with the Ministry of Health . Programmes , he said , were not directly targeted on indigenous peoples but addressed health needs such as malaria control and immunization , water supply and sanitation . He noted that there was a need for disaggregation of data to learn more about the health needs of vulnerable groups such as the Basarwa . The representative of UNAIDS said that a five-year programme was being developed to combat HIV / AIDS although no specific activity was directed at indigenous peoples . In the ensuing discussion , the representative of UNDP noted that HIV / AIDS affected 38 per cent of the adult population of the country . In his view , roads had however contributed to the spread of the endemic and this meant that previously remote area dwellers were now vulnerable . He said that in Gantzi , an area where many Basarwa lived , no cases of HIV / AIDS had been recorded before the building of the road . In the case of the Basarwa , lack of community knowledge about HIV / AIDS resulted in the rapid spread of the virus . In answer to a question relating to the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People , Mr. Kamau said that no specific action had been undertaken in Botswana to celebrate the Decade but that there were many years and decades in the United Nations and it was not always possible to implement activities for all of them especially in work on the ground . He also said that there was little disaggregated data and that it would be helpful to invest in research . This point was reiterated by Ms. Lennox who said that without such data the welfare and poverty of certain groups will be masked . She also said that disaggregated data would enable minorities and indigenous peoples to voice their development concerns to Governments as communities . She underlined that encouraging Governments to recognize multiculturalism was an essential part of improving development policy . One of the participants said that she thought that UNDP should play a role in educating people about the implications of concepts such as “ indigenous peoples ” that were used internationally . In response to this comment , a UNDP representative said that it was not helpful to use terms that people did not understand . Another participant said that until groups were recognized it would not be possible to find out where there were inequalities . Another participant said that indigenous peoples were not seeking special treatment but equality and non-discrimination . Indigenous peoples , he said , was a term that denoted marginalization and exclusion . He said that the United Nations agencies should not be working towards the assimilation of indigenous peoples . The UNDP representative concluded by calling for participatory development which he thought would benefit indigenous peoples .
